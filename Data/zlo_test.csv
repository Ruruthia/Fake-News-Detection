Trump Says He May Tour North Korean Political Prisons to ‘See How It’s Done’ | WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration is working closely with North Korean officials to arrange an exclusive tour of the hermit kingdom’s notorious political prison system during an upcoming state visit to Pyongyang next year. “They have a very good system over there,” President Trump told reporters during a brief exchange on the South Lawn on Friday. “They put the whole family in there and if you look at the situation they’ve done a tremendous job in terms of dealing with dissent.” Mr. Trump, who has made criminal-justice reform a top priority since taking office in January 2017, called the North Korean model “one of the best in the world.” A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press told The Washington Examiner that in a recent letter to the president, North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-un suggested three possible prison camp locations for Mr. Trump’s highly anticipated trip to Pyongyang in 2020. “Given its close proximity to the capital, the Kaechon internment camp was the obvious choice,” the official told The Examiner. Located approximately forty miles north of Pyongyang, Kaechon –otherwise known as Camp 14– is a sixty-square-mile forced labor camp housing some 15,000 individuals deemed “politically unreliable” by the state. Prisoners of all ages –including women and children– work from 5:30 a.m. until midnight seven days a week mining coal – a major selling point for President Trump, who campaigned on the promise of reviving the ailing U.S. coal industry. “We’ll have to look at it very carefully, but I will tell you if we end up doing something like that here it will be very good for the economy,” the president said. One of thirteen active political prison camps in North Korea, Kaechon is often referred to as a “total control zone,” meaning those imprisoned within its walls will remain there for life. For more heinous crimes such as openly criticizing the government or illegally possessing a Bible, convicts are subjected to the “three generations of punishment” rule, a form of kin punishment whereby immediate family members of the condemned are also handed a life sentence. Citing security concerns, President Donald J. Trump on Friday said only a handful of “vetted” journalists will be allowed to accompany him on his visit to the North Korean labor camp. “We’re definitely bringing Jim Acosta,” the president said moments before boarding Marine One, adding, “We may even leave him there, I don’t know, we’ll see what happens.”
Newlywed Couple’s Camping Trip Turns into Scene From Horror Movie | LEXINGTON, Va. – When David and Kristen Kemp embarked on a long-awaited post-wedding camping trip in Virginia’s tranquil Blue Ridge mountains last summer, the thirty-something year-old couple never imagined they would end up spending their honeymoon as targets of a maniacal family of hatchet-wielding psychopaths. But that’s exactly what happened when the pair were abducted from their tent in the dead of night and held against their will in a rusted out Windstream camper where they were tortured and later dismembered by a disgruntled slaughterhouse supervisor known only to locals as The Tree. Thirty-one year-old David Kemp, who was burned repeatedly with a welding torch and locked in a dog crate over a period of eight days, described the harrowing experience in an exclusive interview with People Magazine. “I was just beside myself,” the recent University of Virginia graduate admitted. “I mean one minute we’re gathering wood for a fire and the next thing I know, M. Night Shyamalan walks into our camp and asks if we want to be extras in his movie.” “Of course I had to agree to it,” David’s stunningly beautiful new wife, Kristen, told People Magazine. Mrs. Kemp, a seventh grade social studies teacher and die-hard Joaquin Phoenix fan, said she and her husband have been “Shyamalan junkies” ever since going to see Split (2016) on their first date. “It was love at first sight,” Kristen said, laughing. “David will disagree with me on this but I have to say, The Happening was easily M. Night’s best movie.” When asked, David – who adamantly disagreed with his wife’s assessment – said After Earth (2013) was his favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie. “Jaden Smith’s portrayal of Kitai Raige was one of the most moving performances I’ve seen to date,” said David, who later admitted he’s followed Jaden Smith’s career since he first appeared in the music video for Will Smith’s Black Suits Comin’ (Nod Ya Head) at the age of four. A spokesperson for M. Night Shyamalan’s production company, Blinding Edge Pictures, told Real News Right Now that Mr. and Mrs. Kemp received “a fair wage” to appear as a pair of doomed hikers in the upcoming psychological thriller. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and Jared Leto, Trees is the latest addition to M. Night Shyamalan’s ever-growing list of blockbuster films. Trees is tentatively scheduled for release in the fall of 2018.
Idris Elba to Play Bruce Wayne in Tyler Perry’s ‘Dark Knight’ Remake | LOS ANGELES, Ca. – British actor and musician Idris Elba has landed the lead role in Tyler Perry’s upcoming adaptation of Christopher Nolan’s 2008 crime drama The Dark Knight, the actor’s publicist, Michelle Benson, confirmed on Tuesday. “Idris is thrilled to be a part of this project,” Ms. Benson told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s been a lifelong dream of his to portray Batman.” Director Tyler Perry, whose previous films include Madea Goes to Jail and Diary of a Mad Black Woman, described himself as a die-hard fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy but said the film’s “distinct lack” of African-American actors inspired him to produce a remake. “We’ve got a great group of people working on this,” Perry told BET. “Kat Williams is playing the Joker. A lot of people said Heath Ledger made a great Joker, but I’m telling you now, wait until you see Kat.” Also included in the all-star cast is iconic rapper turned actor Ice Cube. One of the pioneers of gangsta rap, the former member of N.W.A. has signed on to play Lieutenant Jim Gordon. In a recent interview with The Source, Ice Cube said he plans to bring a “21 Jump Street-style vibe” to the Gotham City Police Department. In addition, comedian Kevin Hart is expected to appear in a minor role as Robin, Batman’s loyal sidekick. Actor and author Sir Michael Caine, who played Bruce Wayne’s British butler and valet throughout The Dark Knight Trilogy, will appear in Perry’s adaptation – again – as Alfred Pennyworth. “I’m just relieved I don’t have to relearn my lines,” the actor joked. A source with first-hand knowledge of the casting process confirmed to Real News Right Now that Caine is the film’s only Caucasian actor. Tyler Perry’s upcoming and highly anticipated movie, The Black Knight, is set to hit theaters in the spring of 2017. The film is rumored to have a budget of $380 million, more than twice that of the original motion picture directed by Christopher Nolan.
George Clooney Claims Exhaustion, Anxiety, Postpones Filming Following Fork Incident | EDINA, Mn. – Academy Award winning actor George Clooney is refusing to leave his trailer on the set of the latest Cohen brothers’ film in Edina, Minnesota, after an incident at a nearby Cheesecake Factory left the actor with a strong distaste for the sweet dessert. On Friday, April 21st, Mr. Clooney and his wife, Amal, dropped by the Cheesecake Factory on Southdale Circle in downtown Edina, where they shared a slice of Mango Key Lime cheesecake. “They liked it so much, they ordered a second slice,” Assistant manager Blanche Wilson later told TMZ. “In fact,” she added, “Mr. Clooney bought everyone who was in the restaurant that day a slice of cheesecake.” However, after Mr. Clooney settled his bill and left, Blanch told TMZ she “swooped in before the busboy” and rescued a salad fork used by Clooney. “I just knew I was holding a piece of history,” she said. The fifty-nine year-old assistant manager said she rushed to the kitchen where she expertly used a vacuum storage bag to preserve the treasured fork before listing it on the popular online auction site, eBay, with a jaw-dropping starting bid of one million dollars. Within an hour, an intense bidding war erupted between at least two potential buyers. “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Blanche said. “Every time I logged in, there was a new bid.” By the following morning, the auction had ended and Blanche Wilson was suddenly – and remarkably – eight million dollars richer. “I was ecstatic,” she told TMZ. “The first thing I did was call my hair dresser and make an appointment.” In an exclusive interview with Real News Right Now, George Clooney, speaking via Skype from inside his trailer, revealed that it was he who had placed the winning $8 million bid on the salad fork. “I’m just not comfortable with the idea of strangers having my DNA,” Clooney explained before adding that the mere thought of someone having something he’s touched leaves him crippled with anxiety. Mr. Clooney told Real News Right Now that over the last decade, he’s spent upwards of one hundred million dollars in online auctions in an effort to prevent his DNA from falling into the wrong hands. “I’ve got a little operation in my basement where I pay a couple of neighborhood kids twelve bucks an hour to scour the Internet and bid on things that I’ve had contact with,” Clooney said, adding that if he had the time to do it himself, he would. Clooney had reportedly visited the Cheesecake Factory in Edina to prepare for his role as ‘Pete’ in the latest Cohen brothers’ film, ‘Cheesecake Factory,’ a period piece set in the early 1990’s, according to the actor’s publicist.
Pope Francis Says ‘Strong Possibility’ World Ended in November, We Are Now in Hell | VATICAN CITY – Speaking to millions of jubilant worshipers during a live-streamed Mass at the Vatican’s Casa Santa Marta on Sunday, Pope Francis called upon Europeans to join together in unity, saying the European Union’s twenty-seven nations must come together “in a spirit of harmony and of collaboration” to combat the coronavirus pandemic. However, in his midday address at the Apostolic Palace, the pope suggested the need for collaboration among the EU’s member states may not be as pressing a matter as he let on during his homily just hours before. Instead, Pope Francis spoke of a “strong possibility” that life as we know it ended “in the blink of an eye” some time in late November of 2019. The Holy See Press Office was quick to defend the pope’s controversial statements on the Fifth Sunday of Easter, with spokesperson Matteo Bruni telling reporters that Vatican officials have been working closely with NASA, the World Health Organization, and [REDACTED] to determine exactly what led to last year’s extinction of all life on earth. “The working theory is a large asteroid roughly four times the size of the sun obliterated the planet,” Mr. Bruni explained before adding, “It’s entirely possible that it happened and we didn’t know.” While the Vatican has stopped short of admitting that our new reality is in fact Hell, Pope Francis concluded his midday address on Sunday by asking Christians around the world to “consider the timely emergence of the 5G network and the murder wasp” amidst the backdrop of a global health crisis, and recalled that “the bible does not explicitly state that God’s gift of eternal life is good.” Still, Vatican officials expressed confidence in the ongoing operation to determine the precise source of Earth’s abrupt demise. “We’ll get to the bottom of this,” a senior Vatican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press told Real News Right Now. “We have sources in high places,” the official revealed, quickly backtracking. “At least we did. We still do – I’m sure of it.”
Denmark Offers to Sell U.S. a Bridge in Brooklyn | COPENHAGEN, Dk. – Days after U.S. president Donald J. Trump abruptly cancelled a highly anticipated state visit to Denmark over a failed bid to purchase Greenland, Danish prime minister Mette Frederikson offered a compromise, saying the European nation is willing to sell the United States a bridge in Brooklyn for $1 billion. “It’s a very nice bridge, in fact, some might say it’s the best bridge,” Frederikson told BBC News, adding that the overpass, often referred to as the ‘Brooklyn Bridge,’ would be a fine addition to President Trump’s home state of New York. “One of the most fascinating aspects of this particular bridge,” Prime Minister Frederikson explained, “is that a person is able to traverse the East River without the need of a boat or a fashionable pair of swim trunks.” Denmark had initially intended to sell the bridge at an upcoming European Union auction with a starting bid of 4.5 billion Euros, but following the tragic news of President Trump’s cancelled visit, hundreds of thousands of devastated Danes took to the streets of Copenhagen in a show of solidarity with the American people. “We know how much this visit meant to the Americans,” Emil Pedersen, a twenty-nine year-old web developer from Aarhus, told Sky News. “Just knowing that Mr. Trump is out of the country –if only for a few days– must feel like an enormous weight has been lifted from the backs of every man, woman, and child in America.” Despite the results of the 2013 World Happiness Report, which ranked Danes as the happiest people on earth, many in the Scandinavian country were brought to their knees in overwhelming anguish this week upon learning that President Trump would not grace the pristine streets of Copenhagen with his world-renowned compassion and goodwill towards mankind. “There was a strong feeling that something had to be done to remedy this – and quickly,” former Danish parliament member Rasmus Jarlov told BBC News. Following an emergency session of Parliament on Thursday, Danish officials, in an effort to smooth things over with their staunch American allies, voted unanimously in favor of giving President Donald J. Trump the option to purchase the Brooklyn Bridge for $1 billion, a fraction of its starting bid at next year’s EU auction. “It would take a feeble-minded imbecile to look at this and not see the irrefutable benefits of this once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity,” Prime Minster Frederikson said, continuing, “This bridge is, to put it frankly, an astounding architectural achievement and a testament to the ingenuity of the human race.”
Experts Say Millennials Are Inhaling Too Much Oxygen | CAMBRIDGE, Ma. – While Millennials account for just twenty-two percent of the U.S. population, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say that in the age of COVID-19, Millennials are consuming far more oxygen than the earth is capable of producing. “Current trends show Millennials are on track to inhale upwards of twenty-five tons of oxygen per year -more than twice the global average,” explained Dr. Ross E. Geller, the study’s chief researcher. Geller, who holds a PhD in paleontology from Columbia University, warned that oxygen consumption in the United States alone has risen by more than 700% since February. Due to social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders, Millennials -often referred to as the Privileged Generation- are leaving their apartments in droves, gallivanting through otherwise deserted streets and neighborhoods, and assembling in parks and other public spaces for the purpose of exercising, socializing, and other “extracurricular” activities such as vaping and dog walking. “Our planet only produces so much oxygen per year,” said Dr. Gordon Freeman, an MIT alumni and researcher who holds a PhD in theoretical physics. “Millennials nowadays have so much free time on their hands due to COVID-“19, and, as we’re seeing, the vast majority of the ‘elitist generation’ insist on being outdoors where they’re sucking up sixty to seventy percent of the world’s oxygen supply.” As scientists race to find a solution to the Millennial question, experts say older generations may soon find themselves short on oxygen. “Those in the greater and greatest generations could be inhaling close to 100% carbon dioxide by the end of the year,” Dr. Geller predicted. However, younger generations such as Z and Alpha are known to have much smaller lungs than full grown adults and therefore require very little, if any, oxygen to survive.
Scientists Say Mysterious Objects Found in Argentine Dinosaur Bones Not Tumors | PATAGONIA, Ar. – When archaeologists reviewed the results of a bone scan performed on the skeletal remains of a newly discovered species of dinosaur known as the Patagotitan, they believed they were looking at evidence of tumors in the fossilized bones of six young adult dinosaurs. The scans, which were conducted using a device known as a scintillation camera, revealed the presence of several dozen fist-sized objects lodged in the vertebrae, ribs, and shoulder blades of all six creatures. “Initially we thought we were looking at a form of metastatic cancer,” said Dr. Joel Villarroel, a visiting fellow at the Smithsonian’s Department of Anthropology. While little is known about dinosaur diseases, recent studies show the Hadrosaurs, a “duck-billed” species from the Triassic period, were prone to cancer. “We wanted to know if Patagotitan were also susceptible to malignant tumors,” explained Dr. Villarroel. However, further analysis conducted at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History revealed the embedded objects were not tumors at all. “In fact, what we’ve found are fragments of a type of metal known as trequiotite,” Dr. Nicholas Riviera, the Smithsonian Institute’s chief metallurgist, told the Journal of Archaeological Science. Discovered in 2013 by NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, trequiotite is native to the Red Planet and possesses a density more than thirty times higher than osmium, Earth’s heaviest metal. “Scant traces of sulfur recovered from both the Patagotitan bones and the trequiotite fragments suggest these objects may have been a type of projectile,” Dr. Riviera said. While extremely unusual, experts say the discovery of the so-called Martian “projectiles” is consistent with other prehistoric artifacts unearthed in South America throughout the 1970s. “There are nine grave sites in the Patagonia region alone where you have an abundance of fossilized remains showing signs of perimortem trauma,” Dr. Villarroel explained, continuing, “At seven of those sites, remnants of what appear to be an unknown type of firearm were found buried or perhaps discarded a short distance away from the fossilized remains.” The discovery of Martian metal fragments embedded in the fossilized remains of over half a dozen dinosaurs has left many in the scientific community questioning how the prehistoric creatures came to be extinct. “The fact is we may never know what life was like three hundred and sixty-five million years ago,” said Dr. Nicholas Riviera. “What was happening in our solar system? Were Martians engaged in a sort of interplanetary war with these creatures we’ve come to know as dinosaurs? Were they killed off, not by a meteor, but by a highly advanced nuclear weapon? That’s why breakthroughs such as this are so essential to understanding our place in the universe.”
Scientists Say Staring at the Sun for Twenty Seconds a Day Could Prevent Astigmatism | g headaches and blurred vision. “This will likely be the most significant scientific breakthrough of the twenty-first century,” predicted the project’s lead researcher, Dr. Kenneth Rocco. The fifty-one year-old ophthalmologist, who was banned from practicing medicine in the United States following an unspecified incident in 2002, conducted the study with the help of Dr. Valdis Jansons, a former Latvian State Security official who now serves as headmaster for the country’s largest orphanage. Under the indirect supervision of Dr. Jansons and his staff, Dr. Rocco has spent the past four years conducting extensive testing and research on more than two dozen handpicked orphans. “I am very close to unlocking the secrets of the eye,” Dr. Rocco told The New England Journal of Medicine. “The eye, as you are well aware, is capable of seeing far more than what our primitive brains can even begin to comprehend.” In December of 2015, Dr. Rocco’s research yielded a startling discovery. “At that time, I was conducting a critical investigation into the benefits of sunlight,” Dr. Rocco explained. “However, due to an unannounced visit from the Red Cross, I only had six orphans at my disposal. By the grace of God, I was able to make do.” Every day at noon, Dr. Rocco would usher his adolescent test subjects into the orphanage’s dilapidated courtyard. There, he instructed them to stare directly into the center of the sun for sixty seconds. “I performed these trials for thirty days straight,” said Dr. Rocco, continuing, “At the close of each session, I would examine the orphans’ eyes for signs of trauma.” While half of the test subjects fell victim to permanent blindness as a direct result of Dr. Rocco’s experiments, all six of them tested negative for astigmatism. “I gathered my research and immediately drove to Riga [the capital of Latvia] to present my findings to the Ministry of Health.” On February 1, 2017, Latvia’s Ministry of Health formally adopted Dr. Kenneth Rocco’s findings and subsequently launched a nationwide initiative to educate the Latvian people on the health benefits of staring directly into the sun. For his part, Dr. Rocco has put his vital research on hold in order to better focus his efforts on spreading awareness about the sun’s benefits. He expects he will receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his research.
Target to Pull Super Mario Games Amid Allegations They ‘Unfairly Stereotype’ Italian Americans | MINNEAPOLIS, Mn. – As of March 1st, 2019, Target will no longer sell Super Mario Bros. video games and related merchandise, a spokesperson for the Target Corporation announced on Thursday. The decision to pull the popular Nintendo series comes amid mounting calls for Congress to ban the sale of Super Mario Bros. products on the grounds that the series is designed to ‘unfairly stereotype’ Italian Americans. “Frankly, I think Nintendo should apologize for contributing to anti-Italianism on a global scale,” charged U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tx). Mr. Cruz, who is 12.5% Italian, told The Washington Times he finds it extremely hurtful to see his “fellow countrymen depicted in such a negative light.” At the urging of a handful of prominent interest groups including the Italian American Plumbers Association, Senator Cruz introduced legislation this week that if passed, could effectively ban the manufacture, sale, and purchase of all forms of Super Mario-related content and merchandise throughout the United States and its territories. “Italian Americans have suffered this injustice for far too long,” Mr. Cruz charged during an impassioned speech on the Senate floor. “Italians are, by far, the most persecuted group in video game history,” Rupert Babbage, a leading video game historian at the University of Cambridge, told Real News Right Now. “When you look at something like the Super Mario franchise, it’s not hard to find evidence of covert racism,” Babbage explained, continuing, “Case in point, we have the mushroom, an integral part of the Mario universe which also happens to be Italy’s national fungi. Further, we have the Mushroom Kingdom; another obvious discriminatory reference to Italy.” While the issue of racism is a central theme in the movement to ban the Super Mario Bros. franchise, experts say the series has inspired real-world violence on numerous occasions. “At least seven murders have been attributed to the game since its initial release in 1985, including an instance where an Ohio man used a bucket of flaming tennis balls to kill his neighbor,” explained Ronan O’Connor, a retired NYPD homicide detective and self-described anti-Mario advocate. “Barring any sort of effective legislation, the number of Mario-inspired murders in this country could double by 2050,” O’Connor warned. As to why Nintendo may have decided to single out Italians when it created the Super Mario Bros. remains a mystery. However, Rupert Babbage offered some professional insight into the matter: “Being that Nintendo is a Japanese company, it’s no secret they’ve harbored some resentment towards Italy since World War II,” the video game historian explained. “The reason being is that when Italy broke ties with the Axis Powers and declared war on Germany in 1943 – that move inadvertently led to the nuclear bombing of Japan two years later.”
MLB Beginning To Suspect Pirates Just A Mob Front | PITTSBURGH—Speculating as to how the listless franchise has still managed to stay open all these years, sources close to the MLB confirmed Friday that the league has begun to suspect the Pittsburgh Pirates are just a mob front. “It must be some kind of money-laundering operation, because they’re clearly doing the bare minimum to keep that place open,” said Commissioner Rob Manfred, pointing to the fact the team remains fully staffed despite any tangible success in the last four decades as proof they are at the very least selling drugs in the back of the stadium. “I’m not sure how they were even able to afford such a nice place when they hardly win games. It’s empty and super creepy all the time, even at the height of the season. If you walk up and ask for a ticket, they give you a weird look, like they clearly are not expecting real customers. I don’t know how they make any money—they can’t be funding this whole thing on hotdog sales alone.” At press time, the Pirates announced plans to cease baseball operations in favor of a new dry-cleaning service.
Lady Gaga, J. Lo To Perform At Biden Inauguration | Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem and J. Lo will perform a musical number as part of next Wednesday’s inaugural ceremonies for President-Elect Joe Biden. What do you think? “This feels like a missed opportunity to reach across the aisle to Shakira fans.” IAN SIPRAK, LONGTIME EMPLOYEE “At this point in the pandemic, musicians have to take whatever gigs are available.” BORIS ZORMAN, UNEMPLOYED “I think it’d bring the country together if Biden let Trump sing the anthem.” DIANA KAPLAN, LAWN ORNAMENT ARTIST
‘She’s Now Eating A Muffin In The Commissary,’ Posts Congresswoman Boebert Continuing To Livetweet Pelosi’s Location | WASHINGTON—Following her brief suspension from the social media platform, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) continued to livetweet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s location Friday, posting “She’s now eating a muffin in the commissary.” “The Speaker has discarded the baking cup and is now pouring herself a cup of coffee—no, she’s going for tea,” reported Boebert, who shared minute-by-minute updates on Pelosi’s current whereabouts with her hundreds of thousands of right-wing followers, along with a series of blurry photos of the House speaker rummaging through a drawer for sweetener. “The Speaker has selected Splenda. Interesting, she usually goes for Sweet’N Low. She’s flicking the packet now. Oh, we’re on the move! The Speaker is walking down the hallway. We’re going fast now, I’d say five, six miles per hour. Update: the Speaker has broken a heel. She’s entered the bathroom! I repeat, the Speaker has entered the bathroom, and has barricaded herself inside a stall.” At press time, Boebert was standing on the toilet in the adjacent stall, attempting to clamber her way over the top.
U.S. Mint Introduces New Seven-Cent Coin To Bolster Citizens’ Math Skills | WASHINGTON—Explaining they were excited to “kick things up a notch,” officials from the U.S. Mint announced Friday a new seven-cent coin to bolster citizens’ math skills. “Let’s face it, we made it way too easy the first time,” said U.S. Mint Director David J. Ryder, who shared the bureau’s hopes that the new denomination, which would be called a ‘septi,’ would provide a greater challenge. “The nation has lagged behind other countries in terms of core addition, subtraction, and multiplication skills for years, but it’s not because we’re ‘stupid’ or bad at math—we just need a little practice. It’ll just require a little more focus next time you’re doing laundry or buying groceries. We believe in you guys. And don’t use a calculator, that just defeats the whole purpose.” At press time, Ryder added the U.S. Mint would also be introducing a new irrational number dollar bill next year, valued at the square root of 5, to help citizens brush up on their algebra.
Nation Enters New Phase Of Vaccine Distribution Where Capricorns, Gymnasts, Childless Uncles Now Eligible For Inoculation | ATLANTA—Reviewing changes to the priorities for Covid-19 vaccine recipients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday that the nation was entering a new phase of vaccine distribution where Capricorns, gymnasts, and childless uncles were now eligible for inoculation. “If you are between the ages of 49 and 52, were born in Iowa but now live in Ohio, reside exactly 3.25 miles from a hospital, or have bowled a 300 game, you should proceed to a medical facility to receive your Covid vaccine,” said Anne Schuchat, deputy director at the CDC, adding that health officials hoped to provide further clarity on the order in which people should receive the vaccine, as well as prioritize the fourth-generation Dutch immigrants, Panera Bread regional managers, and Miami Heat season-ticket holders most in need of inoculation. “After Capricorns, any Gemini with exactly three roommates and Celiac disease should be ready during phase 3f, but first we have to finish with phases 2b and 3m, which target pastry chefs, firefighters, anyone who served in the first Iraq War but not the second, people who live across the street from a law office, Rhea Seehorn, men who are five-foot-seven, and women who are five-foot-nine. If you’ve ever worked at a Dairy Queen, have between 32 and 39 followers on Instagram, had your appendix removed on a Tuesday, or write your name with little hearts over the i’s, you’re also still eligible, although that eligibility ends in six hours, so you’d better get a move on. If you’re not sure whether you should get vaccinated now, just remember the acronym CBICQCVIW. We hope this clears things up.” At press time, the CDC announced it had thrown away 5,000 expired vaccines and arrested a Taurus with stepchildren who had tried to cut the line.
Christmas Tree Farmer Scatters Sack Of Candy Canes Before Ravenous Douglas Firs | GRANVILLE, OH—Calling “Sooey, sooey!” and rattling his burlap bag, local Christmas tree farmer Drew Allen scattered candy canes from a sack to a pen full of ravenous Douglas firs, sources confirmed Monday. “Come and get it now—we want you all to grow into big, strong 7-footers for Christmas,” said Allen, who reportedly reached out to pat his favorite tree on the trunk and then laid a candy cane flat on his palm for the conifer to eat from his hand. “That’s right, it’s feeding time. Come get your peppermint. Hey, easy, easy! Leave some for the littles ones, okay? Some of them look about half-starved. I need all of you to have bright and shiny needles before I cut you down and send you to the city.” At press time, reports confirmed the rapid approach of Christmas had led Allen to fatten up his scrawniest trees by filling their trough from a bucket of gingerbread and fruitcake slop.
Baker Mayfield’s Commercial Agent Furious He Continues to Risk Everything By Playing Football | CLEVELAND—Chastising his biggest client’s immaturity and lack of concern for professional obligations, Baker Mayfield’s commercial agent Patrick Hayes told sources Wednesday that he is furious that the quarterback continues to risk his career by playing football. “He’s got millions of dollars on the line, and yet he continues to ignore the risk it poses to his job and spend all his free time playing football,” said Hayes, who warned Mayfield that if he continues to risk his body and mind playing football for fun, he may never set foot on a soundstage ever again. “He’s going to need his brain to memorize scripts. He came into Progressive filming one day after spending all Sunday playing football and could barely remember any of his lines. It’s a distraction, too. If he was really focused on this, we could have him doing Pepsi or Ford.” Hayes added that the talent agency was thinking about adding something in Mayfield’s next contract to ban him from engaging in extracurricular football activities.
Conservatives Accuse Nature Of Silencing Right-Wing Voices After Sheldon Adelson Dies At 87 | WASHINGTON—Insisting the billionaire’s demise would have a chilling effect on democracy, conservatives accused nature Tuesday of silencing right-wing voices after GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson died at 87. “It’s disgusting and frankly un-American that nature decided it had the right to unilaterally end Sheldon Adelson’s existence after nearly nine decades of being alive,” said Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, who, along with others in his party, promised to bring an investigation against the concept of time for its role in abruptly stifling the casino magnate just days after Trump supporters rioted inside the Capitol. “Tell me, why is Ronald Reagan dead but Jimmy Carter still alive? I’ll tell you, it’s anti-conservative bias. The Declaration of Independence guarantees every American the right to life, and I’m not going to sit idly by while the laws of biology muzzle great patriots like Mr. Adelson. People dying of old age is what happens in China or Nazi Germany, not the great U.S. of A.” At press time, right-wing leaders were urging fellow Republicans to boycott nature by setting fire to their lawns.
Nation Settles On Being Home To Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame As New Foundation For American Exceptionalism | CLEVELAND—Concluding that the museum was now the country’s most praiseworthy, distinguishing feature, the United States reportedly resolved Tuesday that being home to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame would serve as the new foundation for American exceptionalism. “While our claim to be the world’s foremost democracy is open to dispute, we remain the only nation on Earth with a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” said historian Fran Kimball of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, emphasizing that no other country in the free world had ever put Prince’s love-symbol-shaped guitar, Michael Jackson’s iconic glove, and Elvis Presley’s custom-built SuperTrike motorcycle under one roof. “There are certainly other museums around the world, even other music museums, but do they have ZZ Top’s ‘Eliminator’ hot rod on display? They do not. Thus, America remains the indispensable country.” At press time, a new poll found the majority of the nation supported military action against Austria, arguing that an invasion of Vienna’s House of Music was necessary to preserve American values.
Desperate AMC Touts Theaters As Nice Dark Places For Teens To Rub Each Other’s Genitals | LEAWOOD, KS—In an attempt to boost ticket sales by reminding young patrons of the unique benefits offered by cinema, the increasingly desperate movie chain AMC Theaters rolled out a new marketing campaign Thursday that touted its venues as nice dark places for teens to rub each other’s genitals. “Our top-of-the-line multiplexes offer teenage moviegoers the unparalleled, multisensory experience of grinding on one another in a dark and unsupervised place where the latest box-office hits are always playing,” said marketing executive Amanda Crenshaw, adding that all AMC theaters had been outfitted with comfortable, reclining seats in which adolescent viewers could enjoy erogenous-zone stimulation over or under their clothes. “Even the most high-end home setups still require you to hide any mutual fondling under a blanket in case a parent walks in, but at AMC you can relax beneath a 50-foot screen while sticking your hands down your partner’s pants or dry humping in one of our dimly lit back corners. Plus, our state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos sound system ensures that no matter where you sit, you can breathe and moan heavily into your girl- or boyfriend’s ear without being overheard by the people in front of you. Nothing quite compares to a night at the movies, whether you reach climax or just wind up going home with chafed, aching genitals.” Crenshaw went on to add that teenage patrons who were not currently hooking up with anyone might still enjoy doing a bunch of edibles, getting extremely high, and having a public panic attack during an eardrum-blasting action sequence.
