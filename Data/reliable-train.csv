Emu on the loose! Georgia deputies find big bird by highway | A big bird spotted running amok beside a Georgia highway is headed to a new home where it won’t endanger traffic. Sheriff’s deputies in Brooks County got a call about an escaped emu posing a potential hazard along Highway 133. The large, flightless bird was safely rounded up within a couple of hours Wednesday, WCTV-TV reported. A photo posted by the Brooks County Fire Department on Facebook showed deputies standing around a large animal cage containing the bird. The post read: “The emu has been captured!” Authorities said they had found the emu a new home. The emu is one of the world’s largest bird species.
Cheers! French wine, vines headed home after year in space | The International Space Station bid adieu Tuesday to 12 bottles of French Bordeaux wine and hundreds of snippets of grapevines that spent a year orbiting the world in the name of science. SpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule undocked with the wine and vines — and thousands of pounds of other gear and research, including mice — and aimed for a splashdown Wednesday night in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Tampa. The Atlantic had been targeted, but poor weather shifted the arrival to Florida’s other side. SpaceX’s supply ships previously parachuted into the Pacific. The carefully packed wine — each bottle nestled inside a steel cylinder to prevent breakage — remained corked aboard the orbiting lab. Space Cargo Unlimited, a Luxembourg startup behind the experiments, wanted the wine to age for an entire year up there. None of the bottles will be opened until the end of February. That’s when the company will pop open a bottle or two for an out-of-this-world wine tasting in Bordeaux by some of France’s top connoisseurs and experts. Months of chemical testing will follow. Researchers are eager to see how space altered the sedimentation and bubbles. Agricultural science is the primary objective, stresses Nicolas Gaume, the company’s CEO and co-founder, although he admits it will be fun to sample the wine. He’ll be among the lucky few taking a sip. “Our goal is to tackle the solution of how we’re going to have an agriculture tomorrow that is both organic and healthy and able to feed humanity, and we think space has the key,” Gaume said from Bordeaux. With climate change, Gaume said agricultural products like grapes will need to adapt to harsher conditions. Through a series of space experiments, Space Cargo Unlimited hopes to take what’s learned by stressing the plants in weightlessness and turn that into more robust and resilient plants on Earth. There’s another benefit. Gaume expects future explorers to the moon and Mars will want to enjoy some of Earth’s pleasures. “Being French, it’s part of life to have some good food and good wine,” he told The Associated Press. Gaume said private investors helped fund the experiments. He declined to provide the project cost. The wine hitched a ride to the space station in November 2019 aboard a Northrop Grumman supply ship. The 320 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon vine snippets, called canes in the grape-growing business, were launched by SpaceX last March. SpaceX is the only shipper capable of returning space station experiments and other items intact. The other cargo capsules are filled with trash and burn up when reentering Earth’s atmosphere. 
Pandemic restrictions a business boon for some Iraqi women | Fatima Ali was in her final year studying to become a medical analysis specialist when Iraq imposed a full lockdown in March. Forced by a raging pandemic to stay home, she spent her days on social media, looking for something to do with her time. Then an idea came to her: Six years ago, visiting America on a young leaders exchange program, she and other students toured a Vermont cheese factory where aged cheese platters were displayed on wooden boards so inviting they looked like paintings. “I liked it … I said to myself, why not be the first to do it in Baghdad?” She took a free online business course and researched cheeses and wooden plates available in the Iraqi capital. Months later, 22-year-old Ali is successfully marketing her cheese boards, making a small but steady income and garnering over 2,000 Instagram followers. A growing number of Iraqi women are using pandemic restrictions to establish home-based businesses. It’s a way to bypass discrimination and harassment that often come with working in Iraq’s male-dominated, conservative society — and bring in extra income as the economy worsens. On a recent day in her kitchen, Ali cut up and arranged cheeses, dried fruit and nuts as she talked about her further dreams. She wants to go to culinary school abroad and one day open a school in Iraq for those “who have passion for cooking, like me.” “This is just the beginning. I’m still developing myself,” she said. The slogan on her purple T-shirt declared, “You Have to Love Yourself.” Rawan Al-Zubaidi, a business partner at an Iraqi NGO that supports start-ups and young entrepreneurs, said there’s been a noticeable increase in home-based businesses since the pandemic’s start, including women making food deliveries, sweets, accessories, crocheting and embroidering. “It represents a solution to obstacles that Iraqi women face when trying to find a job,” she said, citing women whose husbands or fathers won’t let them work, unsupportive male colleagues, discrimination and lack of career growth opportunities. “Some Iraqi women can’t find a job because conservative families or husbands consider that women talking directly with other men on the job will bring shame on them,” Rawan said. Women’s labor force participation in Iraq is particularly low. As of 2018, only 12.3% of women of working age were employed or looking for work, according to the United Nations. Tamara Amir, who manages a Facebook page to educate Iraqi women about their rights, said she receives dozens of calls each day from women facing sexual harassment at work. Often, they report feeling they have to give their male boss “something in return” to get a job or advancement. Ali’s parents have been supportive of her home-based business, which she says is more secure and means she does not have to go outside and mix with people. Her mother helps her prepare her products, and Ali teamed up with a popular delivery app. At first, she received two orders a week maximum. Now she can barely keep up with the multiple orders she gets every day. Mariam Khzarjian, a 31-year-old Iraqi-Armenian, worked as an executive assistant in an engineering company for seven years. She quit in late 2018, feeling her career was going nowhere, and started her own home business selling handmade accessories inspired by her ancestors, who used to work as carpenters. She called her business Khzar — Armenian for the art of cutting metals and woods — with the slogan “wear a story,” since Khzar designs are based on telling stories and building emotional communication with the clients. She got off to a slow start. Distractions got in the way. But the pandemic forced her to focus, working on new designs and techniques during curfews. The move toward online shopping helped her business take off in a way she could not have imagined. “Online became the only way to reach clients, and they in turn became more loyal and more confident about my art, because they are buying something without trying it,” Khzarjian said. “Corona is terrible, but for those able to take advantage of the internet and build connections with customers, it had its positive side,” she said. Sara al-Nedawi, 23, studied business administration and has tried to find a job for months. “One day I sent my CV to a company, and they texted me to ask if I was pretty and whether I wear the hijab or not,” she said, referring to the headscarf worn by some Muslim women. Someone from another company she applied to called her to get more information, then told her she has a lovely voice and asked for a photo. Now she is trying to start a home-based food-catering business but lacks the capital. “I need to work first to collect enough money,” she said.
Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I’ve had the virus? | Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I’ve had the virus? Yes. Regardless of previous infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people should plan on getting vaccinated when it’s their turn. “It’s a pretty straightforward question,” said Johns Hopkins infectious disease specialist Dr. Amesh Adalja. “Yes, you need to get vaccinated.” After someone recovers, their immune system should keep them from getting sick again right away. “Your immune system is able to identify the virus, and protect itself,” said Dr. Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease expert at George Mason University. Scientists still don’t know exactly how long this immunity lasts or how strong it is, though recent research suggests the protection could last for several months. It’s impossible to know how long a person might be immune, said Dr. Prathit Kulkarni, an infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine. “There’s no way to calculate that.” Vaccines, by contrast, are designed to bring about a more consistent and optimal immune response. And they should boost whatever preexisting immunity a person might have from an infection, experts say. “Since we’re in this pandemic, and don’t have a handle on it, the safer approach is to vaccinate,” Kulkarni said. “You don’t lose anything and you stand to benefit.” If you’ve been infected in the last three months, the CDC says it’s OK to delay vaccination if you want to let others go first while supplies are limited. “All things being equal you would want the person with no protection to go first,” Adalja said.
Identical twins aren’t perfect clones, research shows | If you’re an identical twin who’s always resisted being called a clone of your sibling, scientists say you have a point. Identical twins are not exactly genetically the same, new research shows. Scientists in Iceland sequenced DNA from 387 pairs of identical twins — those derived from a single fertilized egg — as well as from their parents, children and spouses. That allowed them to find “early mutations that separate identical twins,” said Kari Stefansson, a geneticist at the University of Iceland and the company deCODE genetics, and co-author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Nature Genetics. A mutation means an alteration in a sequence of DNA — a tiny change that is not inherently good or bad, but can influence physical features or susceptibility to certain diseases. They can occur when a cell divides and makes a slight error in replicating DNA. On average, identical twins have 5.2 of these early genetic differences, the researchers found. But about 15% of identical twin pairs have more genetic differences, some of them up to 100, said Stefansson. These differences represent a tiny portion of each twin’s genetic code, but they could influence why one twin is taller or why one twin is at greater risk for certain cancers. Previously, many researchers believed that physical differences between identical twins were related mostly to environmental factors, such as nutrition or lifestyle. Jan Dumanski, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved in the new paper, praised it as “a clear and important contribution” to medical research. “The implication is that we have to be very careful when we are using twins as a model” for teasing apart the influences of nature and nurture, he said. Previous studies, including a 2008 paper in The American Journal of Human Genetics, have identified some genetic differences between identical twins. The new study goes beyond earlier work by including DNA of parents, children and spouses of identical twins. That allowed the researchers to pinpoint when genetic mutations occurred in two different kinds of cells — those present in just one individual and those inherited by that person’s children. They also found mutations that occurred before the developing embryo split into two, setting the stage for twins. Stefansson said that his team had found pairs of twins where a mutation is present in all cells of the body of one twin, but not found in the other twin at all. However, “sometimes the second twin may show the mutation in some cells, but not all cells,” he said. Nancy Segal, a psychologist who studies twins at California State University, Fullerton and was not involved in the paper, called the research “heroic and really significant.” “This will force scientists to refine our thinking about the influences of genetics and environment,” she said. “Twins are very alike, but it is not a perfect similarity.”
Japanese spacecraft’s gifts: Asteroid chips like charcoal | They resemble small fragments of charcoal, but the soil samples collected from an asteroid and returned to Earth by a Japanese spacecraft were hardly disappointing. The samples Japanese space officials described Thursday are as big as 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) and rock hard, not breaking when picked up or poured into another container. Smaller black, sandy granules the spacecraft collected and returned separately were described last week. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft got the two sets of samples last year from two locations on the asteroid Ryugu, more than 300 million kilometers (190 million miles) from Earth. It dropped them from space onto a target in the Australian Outback, and the samples were brought to Japan in early December. The sandy granules the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency described last week were from the spacecraft’s first touchdown in April 2019. The larger fragments were from the compartment allocated for the second touchdown on Ryugu, said Tomohiro Usui, space materials scientist. To get the second set of samples in July last year, Hayabusa2 dropped an impactor to blast below the asteroid’s surface, collecting material from the crafter so it would be unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors. Usui said the size differences suggest different hardness of the bedrock on the asteroid. “One possibility is that the place of the second touchdown was a hard bedrock and larger particles broke and entered the compartment.” JAXA is continuing the initial examination of the asteroid samples ahead of fuller studies next year. Scientists hope the samples will provide insight into the origins of the solar system and life on Earth. Following studies in Japan, some of the samples will be shared with NASA and other international space agencies for additional research. Hayabusa2, meanwhile, is on an 11-year expedition to another small and distant asteroid, 1998KY26, to try to study possible defenses against meteorites that could fly toward Earth.
Trump says ‘tremendous anger’ in nation over impeachment | Impeachment ahead, the House on Tuesday will first try to convince the vice president and Cabinet to act even more quickly to remove President Donald Trump from office, warning he is a threat to democracy in the remaining days of his presidency. House lawmakers are reconvening at the Capitol for the first time since the deadly pro-Trump riot to approve a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unable to serve. Pence is not expected to take any such action. The House would next move swiftly to impeach Trump. Trump told reporters at the White House the prospect of impeachment is causing “tremendous anger” in the nation. But he said he wants “no violence.” The president spoke as he left for Texas to survey the border wall with Mexico. His remarks were his first to reporters since the Capitol attack. He took no questions. On impeachment, Trump said it’s “a really terrible thing that they’re doing.” But he said, “We want no violence. Never violence.” Trump faces a single charge — “incitement of insurrection” — in the impeachment resolution that the House will begin debating Wednesday, a week before Democrat Joe Biden is set to be inaugurated, Jan. 20.The unprecedented events, only the first U.S. president to be twice impeached, are unfolding in a nation bracing for more unrest. The FBI has warned ominously of potential armed protests in Washington and many states by Trump loyalists ahead of Biden’s inauguration. In a dark foreshadowing, the Washington Monument was closed to the public and the inauguration ceremony on the west steps of the Capitol will be off limits to the public. It all added up to stunning final moments for Trump’s presidency as Democrats and a growing number of Republicans declare he is unfit for office and could do more damage after inciting a mob that violently ransacked the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot a woman during the violence. Three others died in what authorities said were medical emergencies. “We have to be very tough and very strong right now in defending the Constitution and democracy,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., an author of both pieces of legislation, in an interview. Late Monday, the entire Congressional Hispanic Caucus, all 34 members, unanimously agreed to support impeachment, calling for Trump’s immediate removal. “It is clear that every moment Trump remains in office, America is at risk,” said a statement from the caucus, led by Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca. It said Trump “must be held accountable” for his actions. Democrats aren’t the only ones who say Trump needs to go. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., encouraged House GOP colleagues late Monday to “vote your conscience,” according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private call. She has spoken critically of Trump’s actions but has not said publicly how she will vote. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.” Pence and Trump met late Monday for the first time since the Capitol attack, and had a “good conversation” pledging to continue working for the remainder of their terms, said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Pence has given no indication he would proceed with invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. No member of the Cabinet has publicly called for Trump to be removed from office through the 25th Amendment process. As security tightened, Biden said Monday he was “not afraid” of taking the oath of office outside at the Capitol. As for the rioters, Biden said, “It is critically important that there’ll be a real serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage -- that they be held accountable.” Biden said he’s had conversations with senators ahead of a possible impeachment trial, which some have worried would cloud the opening days of his administration. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was exploring ways to immediately convene the Senate for the trial as soon as the House acts, though Republican leader Mitch McConnell would need to agree. The president-elect suggested splitting the Senate’s time, perhaps “go a half day on dealing with impeachment, a half day on getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package” for more COVID relief. As Congress resumes, an uneasiness swept government. Another lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., announced Tuesday she had tested positive for COVID-19 after sheltering during the siege. Many lawmakers may choose to vote by proxy rather than come to Washington, a process that was put in place last year to limit the health risks of travel. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has discouraged GOP lawmakers from using the proxy option. But during a call with them he loosened his strict opposition for this week’s votes, according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private call. Among Trump’s closest allies in Congress, McCarthy said in a letter to colleagues that “impeachment at this time would have the opposite effect of bringing our country together.” He said he would review possible censure of the president. But House Republicans are split and a few may vote to impeach. Democrats say they have the votes for impeachment. The impeachment bill from Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California, Raskin of Maryland and Jerrold Nadler of New York draws from Trump’s own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud. The impeachment legislation also details Trump’s pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes, as well as his White House rally ahead of the Capitol siege, in which he encouraged thousands of supporters last Wednesday to “fight like hell” and march to the building. The mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College. While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, Democrats and others argue he must be prevented from holding future public office. There is precedent for pursuing impeachment after an official leaves office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.
Trump heads to Texas border in final days to showcase wall | After days out of sight following the Capitol siege, President Donald Trump travels to Texas to trumpet one of the pillars of his presidency: his campaign against illegal immigration. Trump will be flying Tuesday to Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S-Mexican border. The city is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army. Trump’s visit — no doubt a symbol of the president’s defiance — comes as he spends the final days of his presidency isolated, aggrieved and staring down the prospect of a second impeachment after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week in an effort to halt the peaceful transition of power. Aides have been urging the president to instead use the days he has left in office to highlight what they see as the chief accomplishments of his presidency: a massive tax cut, his efforts to roll back federal regulations and the transformation of federal courts with the appointment of conservative judges. But Trump has repeatedly resisted their efforts as he has remained ensconced in the White House, behind closed doors, consumed by baseless allegations of voter fraud and conspiracies. Indeed, the trip will mark the first time Trump has been seen in public since the speech he delivered to his supporters Wednesday, egging them on to “fight” before the Capitol violence. Trump is expected to deliver remarks highlighting his administration’s efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a “big, beautiful wall” across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. Over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat. In the end, his administration has overseen the construction of roughly 450 miles of border wall construction — likely reaching 475 miles by Inauguration Day. The vast majority of that wall replaces smaller barriers that had already existed, though the new wall is considerably more difficult to bypass. Over the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier. Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has warned the next administration that easing Trump administration policies, including a halt to wall construction, would lead to a surge of people seeking to cross the border, creating “an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.” President-elect Joe Biden has said he’d halt construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump’s restrictions on legal immigration and asylum seekers. But Biden and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly, and Biden has said it could take six months for his administration to secure funding and put in place the necessary infrastructure to loosen Trump-era restrictions. Missing from the trip will be Chad Wolf, Trump’s acting Department of Homeland Security secretary. He abruptly resigned Monday, days after he pledged to serve out Trump’s full term. After the Capitol violence, groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center urged Trump to call off his visit. “The violence Trump incited last week, and the violence his anti-immigrant policies cause stem from the alarming mainstreaming of white nationalist ideology that our country must reckon with and fight to uproot,” said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the center’s Immigrant Justice Project. “The president’s planned trip to the border will only further the harm and beget more violence.”
Doggie desserts: Ben & Jerry’s enters the pet food business | Think your dog deserves dessert? So does Ben & Jerry’s. The venerable Vermont ice cream company said Monday it’s introducing a line of frozen dog treats, its first foray into the lucrative pet food market. Doggie Desserts, sold in 4-ounce cups, go on sale in U.S. groceries and pet stores later this month. The treats come in two flavors: pumpkin with cookies and peanut butter with pretzels. Both are made with a base of sunflower butter. They’re made from the same ingredients Ben & Jerry’s uses in its non-dairy human desserts. Ben & Jerry’s is the latest food company to pivot to pets, sensing opportunity as more Americans acquire furry friends. The number of U.S. households with pets rose 6.5% to 84.9 million between 2015 and 2020, according to the American Pet Products Association, a trade group. General Mills, which makes Cheerios and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, bought the Blue Buffalo pet food brand in 2018. Jelly maker J.M. Smucker Co. bought Big Heart Pet Brands — which makes Meow Mix and Milk Bone — in 2015. Three years later, Smucker acquired Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, which makes Nutrish brand pet food. And in April, Nestle bought British natural pet food brand Lily’s Kitchen. Nestle has owned the Purina brand since 2001. Spending on dog treats has ballooned, jumping 44% to $5.5 billion between 2015 and 2020, according to Euromonitor, a data firm. Millennials in particular spend lavishly on their pets and look for pet products with human-grade ingredients, Ben & Jerry’s said. Lindsay Bumps, a global marketing specialist with Ben & Jerry’s, said the company had been eyeing the exponential growth in pet spending and started developing its dog treats early last year. The company consulted with a veterinary nutritionist, regulatory consultants and others to make sure the treats are safe and easy to digest, said Bumps, who is also a certified veterinary technician. As with any treat, owners should go slow with the introduction, offering a spoonful at a time, Bumps said. She suggested putting the dessert in a bowl so dogs have an easier time navigating it. Bumps’ 9-year-old French bulldog, Spock, is a big fan of the peanut butter flavor. The treats — $2.99 per cup or $4.99 for four — will be placed near the popsicles in grocery store frozen food aisles, a few doors down from Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. The pivot to pets doesn’t mean Ben & Jerry’s is seeing any slowdown on the human side. London-based Unilever, which owns Ben & Jerry’s, said in October that its ice cream sales for home consumption grew more than 10% in the most recent quarter. Rattled consumers sought indulgent treats during the pandemic and stocked up on multiple pints during less frequent grocery trips, Bumps said. “This is an opportunity for people to treat their dogs as they’re treating themselves when they grab a pint off the shelf,” she said.
Ireland to apologize for abuses in unwed mothers’ homes | The Irish government is poised to make a formal apology for abuses in church-run homes for unmarried women and their babies, where thousands of infants died and were sometimes buried in mass graves. The final report of an inquiry into the mother-and-baby homes is to be published Tuesday. Prime Minister Micheal Martin is expected to apologize on behalf of the Irish state later in the week. The Sunday Independent newspaper, which disclosed leaked details of the report, said it found that 9,000 children died in 18 different homes during the 20th century. One in seven of all children born in the homes died, far above Ireland’s nationwide infant mortality rate. Church-run homes in Ireland housed orphans, unmarried pregnant women and their babies for most of the 20th century. The institutions have been subject to intense public scrutiny since historian Catherine Corless in 2014 tracked down death certificates for nearly 800 children who died at the former Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway — but could only find a burial record for one child. Investigators later found a mass grave containing the remains of babies and young children in an underground sewage structure on the grounds of the home, which was run by an order of Catholic nuns and closed in 1961. The last of Ireland’s mother-and-baby homes did not shut down until the late 1990s. The inquiry is part of a process of reckoning in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Ireland to come to terms with a history of abuses in church-run institutions, including the shunning and shaming of unwed mothers, many of whom were pressured into giving up their babies for adoption.
They need to chill. Tips for turning seeds into trees | How exciting to think of a full-size tree locked up within each seed still clinging to the branches of sugar maples, hornbeams, oaks, sycamores and other trees at the end of summer. It was with such visions that I dropped an apple seed into some potting soil in an 8-inch clay flowerpot one autumn day years ago. I wish I could write that the seed has now been transformed into a majestic tree. But no, the seed germinated, started to grow, then stalled at about 4 inches high. The reason for the lack of growth was that apple seeds, like the seeds of many other trees native to cold climates, need pre-treatment before they will germinate or grow well. I was lucky the seed germinated at all! Since then, I’ve learned the tricks of growing trees from seeds. FOOL THE SEED If an apple or maple seed grew as soon as it touched ground in late summer or early fall, the life of the tender young seedlings would be short indeed, snuffed out with the first frost. So most tree seeds that ripen in fall are able to stay dormant until they’re convinced that winter is over. You can fool such seeds into growing sooner by keeping them cool and moist for a couple of months. Pack the seeds into plastic bags with moist potting soil, then put the bag in the refrigerator or garage. This process is called “stratification” because nursery growers used to do it by alternating layers of seeds with layers of soil in boxes. Of course, you could also just sow seeds directly outdoors and let them wait out the winter naturally, but then they face hazards like squirrels, birds, flooding and more. It is cool, not cold, temperatures that awaken a seed from sleep. Hours of chilling accumulate only when it’s between about 32 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit. So chilling might begin in autumn but not finish until late winter or spring, thus reducing the likelihood of a seed sprouting during a February warm spell. Or all the chilling might take place in late winter or spring. FURTHER CONSIDERS IN SEED GERMINATION Some seeds have a hard coating which must be made permeable to water before the seed is stratified. One way to let water into redbud, juniper, hornbeam and other hard-coated seeds is to nick them with a small file. Dank warmth will accomplish the same thing as nicking with a file. Pack the seeds into plastic bags, as directed above, but leave them in a warm room for two or three months before stratification. Sycamore and catalpa are among the few fall-ripening seeds that don’t need stratification. Perhaps this is because they hang on the trees late enough into winter so that, by the time they drop to moist ground, temperatures are too cold for germination. Or else it is spring, and just the right time for germination. SPROUTING IS THE FIRST STEP Stratified seeds usually sprout as soon as they have accumulated the number of chilling hours they need. For sugar maple, that means three to four months; for dogwood, four months; for apple, two to three months. Keep an eye on stratifying seeds, because one week they’ll be asleep and a week later -- bingo! -- they’re sprouting fat, white roots. Once seeds sprout, either pot them up or keep them cool enough to hold back growth until it’s time to plant them outdoors. You might wonder, why go to the trouble of planting these seemingly delicate seeds when you can just buy a sturdy young tree at a nursery? Hey, you’re reading this, aren’t you? You’re a gardener; you like to grow plants. Not to mention the satisfaction you’ll get years from now as you look up into the branches of a tall tree you planted from seed.
The great bicycle boom of 2020 | Covid-19 brought about a dramatic increase in bicycle sales in response to the pandemic. Heightened anxiety over public transportation and a surge in exercise has meant that more and more are choosing to use one of the most basic forms of mobility, leading to a so-called “bike boom”. The phenomenon has been well-documented: suppliers have struggled to keep up with demand; cities have redesigned their streets to accommodate an influx of riders; manufacturers are trying to forecast the longevity of the bike’s newfound popularity; economists are considering whether e-bikes’ rising popularity will enable more commuters to get to work. An industry that was already thriving before the pandemic has suddenly accelerated. But what will that mean for the future of bicycles? Cycling has long been one of the fastest, most flexible and reliable methods of transport. Even before the pandemic, millions relied on bicycles to do their jobs or get to work. But when stay-at-home orders temporarily curtailed daily life across the globe, the role of bicycles transformed. One in 10 American adults reported having ridden a bike for the first time in a year (or longer) since the onset of Covid-19, according to research by People for Bikes, an industry coalition based in Colorado, US. And in March 2020, ridership on trails in the US peaked at a threefold increase compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, a nonprofit promoting the development of disused rail lines into trails for walking and cycling in the US. “People were at home with nothing to do, a bike sitting in their garage with flat tires,” says Morgan Lommele, director of state policy at People for Bikes. “One of the barriers to bicycling across the ages is anxiety about a thing with 100 moving parts: people worry, ‘How do I store it? How do I fix it?’” But lockdown changed that. “Suddenly, everyone had the time to tinker.” Fitness apps such as Strava reported huge surges in cycling in unexpected cities such as Los Angeles and Houston. And the data points to similar trends across Europe. “Since the beginning of lockdown in March, we’ve seen a rising demand for bicycles,” says Edoardo Girardi, general manager of Full Speed Ahead Europe. In many regions, gyms and swimming pools have been closed for weeks, “which could be one reason for the increased demand”, says Girardi. “Another could be government incentives.” Indeed, some nations rewarded the purchase of new bikes or bike maintenance expenditures in a bid to encourage ridership during the pandemic. Italy, for example, allocated €210m (£190m/$250m) toward a cash-back programme through which Italian residents who purchased a vehicle without an engine were eligible for a €500 (£450/$590) stipend, while France has established a similar programme. With lockdown measures and social distancing firmly in place, bike retailers suddenly became an “essential service” and were given exemptions from shutting down by governments, putting them on a par with grocery stores. But bicycle manufacturers depend upon a multifaceted, geographically dynamic chain of production, with parts arriving from across the globe – a chain upended by the pandemic. Will Butler-Adams, managing director of UK-based Brompton Bikes, says that the company’s raw metal supplier closed down, while a shipping container carrying their goods sat in Rotterdam for a week, leading to scaled back services and an equipment imbalance. “We saw the lockdown coming months before it happened, because many of our suppliers are in Asia,” says Butler-Adams. “What we weren’t prepared for was the speed at which it hit.”. Brompton sent vulnerable employees home in early February in an effort to minimise health risks, and flew in emergency stock from suppliers in Asia as factories in the UK shut down almost overnight. Because many bicycle components, including drivetrains, derailleurs and brakes, continue to be manufactured almost exclusively in Asia, some in the industry predicted that the coronavirus would shift bike manufacturing toward the UK, says Butler-Adams. In fact, Brompton’s suppliers in Taiwan have continued a robust output, while the company had to scramble for raw material at home, where factories were operating at reduced capacity. “Where we’re in trouble is our European and UK stock,” says Butler-Adams. “Luckily, we had additional supplies in preparation for Brexit – if we didn’t have that emergency material, we would have had to shut down. But of course we’re now going into Brexit with no Brexit stock.” With bikes in such high demand, the company saw a new opportunity: providing nurses, doctors and physicians with bicycles so that they could commute to hospitals and avoid public transportation. Brompton raised £375,000 ($490,000) for its Wheels for Heroes campaign, which supplied nearly 800 bicycles to more than 3,000 health workers in the UK. Brompton also boosted production by 30% and has plans to recruit nearly 200 workers within the next year. Is the bike boom simply a market response to the pandemic, like so many others – outdoor dining, puzzle sales, sourdough bread baking – or will changes such as new bike lanes, corporate commuting incentives and leisure cycling become permanent? “Most of the growth we see is in recreation cycling, which is a gateway to transportation biking,” says Lommele. “People for Bikes is researching the temporary changes cities made as a result of Covid-19, and whether those changes will become permanent.” Among their questions of interest are what factors may help new riders maintain ridership, and how urban design changes brought about during the pandemic may affect cyclists. Some changes seem like they may be built to last. Paris added hundreds of kilometres of pop-up cycle lanes along the Rue du Rivoli, while in London a designated bike lane now runs along Hyde Park. Increased access to bike paths creates more incentives for ridership, which in turn reduces traffic and emissions. Meanwhile, bicycle retailers cannot meet the current demand for road bikes in the $500-$1,500 (£380-£1,140) range, leading consumers to look online for used bikes, fix up their old two-wheelers, or shell out cash for more expensive models. While buy-in from consumers, urban designers and elected officials may make it seem like a robust trend, some business leaders remain sceptical, wondering if it makes sense to invest in boosted bicycle capacity long term given the economic anomalies of 2020. “It’s unlikely that this demand will keep up,” says Girardi. Of course, expanding bicycle ridership depends on more than just an expansion of manufacturers or even access to specific bicycle parts. There’s another, overlooked aspect to the bike boom: the concurrent rise of e-cargo bikes, a phenomenon that has the potential to entirely remodel transportation. Known in the logistics industry as light electric freight vehicles (LEFVs), e-cargo bikes have electrical pedal assistance and can be ridden on roads and bicycle lanes, speeding goods and services to their destinations without getting caught in traffic or spewing emissions. In many cities, an LEFV can travel faster than a traditional delivery van because it can be ridden along bicycle bridges and other shortcuts. For now, good old-fashioned cycling is enjoying a renaissance. Bicycles provide a socially distant way for essential workers and commuters to get around, a healthy alternative to gyms or subways, and a new vision of city streets. “Lockdown meant that suddenly the streets quietened, the air was clean and people felt safe,” says Butler-Adams. “Yes, there was fear of public transport, but mostly it was the joy of experiencing cities as they could be."
The medications that change who we are | “Patient Five” was in his late 50s when a trip to the doctors changed his life. He had diabetes, and he had signed up for a study to see if taking a “statin” – a kind of cholesterol-lowering drug – might help. So far, so normal. But soon after he began the treatment, his wife began to notice a sinister transformation. A previously reasonable man, he became explosively angry and – out of nowhere – developed a tendency for road rage. During one memorable episode, he warned his family to keep away, lest he put them in hospital. Out of fear of what might happen, Patient Five stopped driving. Even as a passenger, his outbursts often forced his wife to abandon their journeys and turn back. Afterwards, she’d leave him alone to watch TV and calm down. She became increasingly fearful for her own safety. Then one day, Patient Five had an epiphany. “He was like, ‘Wow, it really seems that these problems started when I enrolled in this study’,” says Beatrice Golomb, who leads a research group at the University of California, San Diego. Alarmed, the couple turned to the study’s organisers. “They were very hostile. They said that the two couldn’t possibly be related, that he needed to keep taking the medication, and that he should stay in the study,” says Golomb. Ironically, by this point the patient was so cantankerous that he flatly ignored the doctors’ advice. “He swore roundly, stormed out of the office and stopped taking the drug immediately,” she says. Two weeks later, he had his personality back. Others have not been so lucky. Over the years, Golomb has collected reports from patients across the United States – tales of broken marriages, destroyed careers, and a surprising number of men who have come unnervingly close to murdering their wives. In almost every case, the symptoms began when they started taking statins, then promptly returned to normal when they stopped; one man repeated this cycle five times before he realised what was going on. According to Golomb, this is typical – in her experience, most patients struggle to recognise their own behavioural changes, let alone connect them to their medication. In some instances, the realisation comes too late: the researcher was contacted by the families of a number of people, including an internationally renowned scientist and a former editor of a legal publication, who took their own lives. We’re all familiar with the mind-bending properties of psychedelic drugs – but it turns out ordinary medications can be just as potent. From paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the US) to antihistamines, statins, asthma medications and antidepressants, there’s emerging evidence that they can make us impulsive, angry, or restless, diminish our empathy for strangers, and even manipulate fundamental aspects of our personalities, such as how neurotic we are. In most people, these changes are extremely subtle. But in some they can also be dramatic. Back in 2011, a French father-of-two sued the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, claiming that the drug he was taking for Parkinson’s disease had turned him into a gambler and gay sex addict, and was responsible for risky behaviours that had led to him being raped. Then in 2015, a man who targeted young girls on the internet used the argument that the anti-obesity drug Duromine made him do it – he said that it reduced his ability to control his impulses. Every now and again, murderers try to blame sedatives or antidepressants for their offences. If these claims are true, the implications are profound. The list of potential culprits includes some of the most widely consumed drugs on the planet, meaning that even if the effects are small at an individual level, they could be shaping the personalities of millions of people.  Research into these effects couldn’t come at a better time. The world is in the midst of a crisis of over-medication, with the US alone buying up 49,000 tonnes of paracetamol every year – equivalent to about 298 paracetamol tablets per person – and the average American consuming $1,200 worth of prescription medications over the same period. And as the global population ages, our drug-lust is set to spiral even further out of control; in the UK, one in 10 people over the age of 65 already takes eight medications every week. How are all these medications affecting our brains? And should there be warnings on packets? Golomb first suspected a connection between statins and personality changes nearly two decades ago, after a series of mysterious discoveries, such as that people with lower cholesterol levels are more likely to die violent deaths. Then one day, she was chatting to a cholesterol expert about the potential link in the hallway at her work, when he brushed it off as obviously nonsense. “And I said ‘how do we know that?’,” she says. Filled with fresh determination, Golomb scoured the scientific and medical literature for clues. “There was shockingly more evidence than I had imagined,” she says. For one thing, she uncovered findings that if you put primates on a low-cholesterol diet, they become more aggressive. There was even a potential mechanism: lowering the animals’ cholesterol seemed to affect their levels of serotonin, an important brain chemical thought to be involved in regulating mood and social behaviour in animals. Even fruit flies start fighting if you mess up their serotonin levels, but it also has some unpleasant effects in people – studies have linked it to violence, impulsivity, suicide and murder. If statins were affecting people’s brains, this was likely to be a direct consequence of their ability to lower cholesterol.   Since then, more direct evidence has emerged. Several studies have supported a potential link between irritability and statins, including a randomised controlled trial – the gold-standard of scientific research – that Golomb led, involving more than 1,000 people. It found that the drug increased aggression in post-menopausal women though, oddly, not in men. In 2018, a study uncovered the same effect in fish. Giving statins to Nile tilapia made them more confrontational and – crucially – altered the levels of serotonin in their brains. This suggests that the mechanism that links cholesterol and violence may have been around for millions of years. Golomb remains convinced that lower cholesterol, and, by extension, statins, can cause behavioural changes in both men and women, though the strength of the effect varies drastically from person to person. “There are lines of evidence converging,” she says, citing a study she conducted in Sweden, which involved comparing a database of the cholesterol levels of 250,000 people with local crime records. “Even adjusting for confounding factors, it was still the case that people with lower cholesterol at baseline were significantly more likely to be arrested for violent crimes.”. But Golomb’s most unsettling discovery isn’t so much the impact that ordinary drugs can have on who we are – it’s the lack of interest in uncovering it. “There’s much more of an emphasis on things that doctors can easily measure,” she says, explaining that, for a long time, research into the side-effects of statins was all focused on the muscles and liver, because any problems in these organs can be detected using standard blood tests. This is something that Dominik Mischkowski, a pain researcher from Ohio University, has also noticed. “There is a remarkable gap in the research actually, when it comes to the effects of medication on personality and behaviour,” he says. “We know a lot about the physiological effects of these drugs – whether they have physical side effects or not, you know. But we don't understand how they influence human behaviour.” Mischkowski’s own research has uncovered a sinister side-effect of paracetamol. For a long time, scientists have known that the drug blunts physical pain by reducing activity in certain brain areas, such as the insular cortex, which plays an important role in our emotions. These areas are involved in our experience of social pain, too – and intriguingly, paracetamol can make us feel better after a rejection. And recent research has revealed that this patch of cerebral real-estate is more crowded than anyone previously thought, because it turns out the brain’s pain centres also share their home with empathy. For example, fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans have shown that the same areas of our brain become active when we’re experiencing “positive empathy” –pleasure on other people’s behalf – as when we’re experiencing pain. Given these facts, Mischkowski wondered whether painkillers might be making it harder to experience empathy. Earlier this year, together with colleagues from Ohio University and Ohio State University, he recruited some students and spilt them into two groups. One received a standard 1,000mg dose of paracetamol, while the other was given a placebo. Then he asked them to read scenarios about uplifting experiences that had happened to other people, such as the good fortune of “Alex”, who finally plucked up the courage to ask a girl on a date (she said yes). The results revealed that paracetamol significantly reduces our ability to feel positive empathy – a result with implications for how the drug is shaping the social relationships of millions of people every day. Though the experiment didn’t look at negative empathy – where we experience and relate to other people’s pain – Mischkowski suspects that this would also be more difficult to summon after taking the drug. “I'm not entirely junior anymore as a researcher, and to be honest, this line of research is really the most worrisome that I've ever conducted,” he says. “Especially because I’m well aware of the numbers [of people] involved. When you give somebody a drug, you don’t just give it to a person – you give it to a social system. And we really don’t understand the effects of these medications in the broader context.” Empathy doesn’t just determine if you’re a “nice” person, or if you cry while you’re watching sad movies. The emotion comes with many practical benefits, including more stable romantic relationships, better-adjusted children, and more successful careers – some scientists have even suggested that it’s responsible for the triumph of our species. In fact, a quick glance at its many benefits reveals that casually lowering a person’s ability to empathise is no trivial matter. Technically, paracetamol isn’t changing our personalities, because the effects only last a few hours and few of us take it continuously. But Mischkowski stresses that we do need to be informed about the ways it affects us, so that we can use our common sense. “Just like we should be aware that you shouldn't get in front of the wheel if you're under the influence of alcohol, you don't want to take paracetamol and then put yourself into a situation that requires you to be emotionally responsive – like having a serious conversation with a partner or co-worker.” One reason medications can have such psychological clout is that the body isn’t just a bag of separate organs, awash with chemicals with well-defined roles – instead, it’s a network, in which many different processes are linked. For example, scientists have known for a while that the medications used to treat asthma are sometimes associated with behavioural changes, such as an increase in hyperactivity and the development of ADHD symptoms. Then, more recently, research uncovered a mysterious connection between the two disorders themselves; having one increases the risk of having the other by 45-53%. No one knows why, but one idea is that asthma medications bring on ADHD symptoms by altering levels or serotonin or inflammatory chemicals, which are thought to be involved in the development of both conditions. Sometimes these links are more obvious. Back in 2009, a team of psychologists from Northwestern University, Illinois, decided to check if antidepressants might be affecting our personalities. In particular, the team were interested in neuroticism. This “Big Five” personality trait is epitomised by anxious feelings, such as fear, jealousy, envy and guilt. For the study, the team recruited adults who had moderate to severe depression. They gave one third of the study’s participants the antidepressant paroxetine (a kind of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)), one third a placebo, and one third talking therapy. They then checked to see how their mood and personalities changed from the beginning to the end of a 16-week treatment. “We found that massive changes in neuroticism were brought about by the medicine and not very much at all by the placebo [or the therapy],” says Robert DeRubeis, who was involved in the study. “It was quite striking.” The big surprise was that, though the antidepressants did make the participants feel less depressed, the reduction in neuroticism was much more powerful – and their influence on neuroticism was independent of their impact on depression. The patients on antidepressants also started to score more highly for extroversion. It’s important to note that it was a relatively small study, and no one has tried to repeat the results yet, so they may not be totally reliable. But the idea that antidepressants are affecting neuroticism directly is intriguing. One idea is that the trait is linked to level of serotonin in the brain, which is altered by the SSRIs.  While becoming less neurotic might sound like an appealing side-effect, it’s not necessarily all good news. That’s because this aspect of our personalities is something of a double-edged sword; yes, it’s been associated with all kinds of unpleasant outcomes, such as an earlier death, but it’s also thought that anxious over-thinking might be helpful. For example, neurotic individuals tend to be more risk-averse, and in certain situations worrying can improve a person’s performance. The matter takes on a whole new urgency, when you consider that some personality changes can be dramatic. There’s solid evidence that the drug L-dopa, which is used to treat Parkinson’s disease, increases the risk of Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) – a group of problems that make it more difficult to resist temptations and urges. Consequently, the drug can have life-ruining consequences, as some patients suddenly start taking more risks, becoming pathological gamblers, excessive shoppers, and sex pests. In 2009, a drug with similar properties hit the headlines, after a man with Parkinson’s committed a £45,000 ($60,000) ticket scam. He blamed it on his medication, claiming that it had completely changed his personality. The association with impulsive behaviours makes sense, because L-dopa is essentially providing the brain with a dose of extra dopamine – in Parkinson’s disease the part of the brain that produces it is progressively destroyed – and the hormone is involved in providing us with feelings of pleasure and reward. Experts agree that L-dopa is the most effective treatment for many of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and it’s prescribed to thousands of people in the US every year. This is despite a long list of possible side effects that accompanies the medication, which explicitly mentions the risk of unusually strong urges, such as for gambling or sex. In fact, DeRubeis, Golomb and Mischkowski are all of the opinion that the drugs they’re studying will continue to be used, regardless of their potential psychological side-effects. "We are human beings, you know," says Mischkowski. "We take a lot of stuff that is not necessarily always good in every circumstance. I always use the example of alcohol, because it's also a painkiller, like paracetamol. We take it because we feel that it has a benefit for us, and it's OK as long as you take it in the right circumstances and you don't consume too much.". But in order to minimise any undesirable effects and get the most out of the staggering quantities of medications that we all take each day, Mischkowski reiterates that we need to know more. Because at the moment, he says, how they are affecting the behaviour of individuals – and even entire societies – is largely a mystery.
Central Spain records temperatures of -25C after snowstorm | People in central Spain are struggling as a deep freeze follows the weekend's heavy snow, leading to treacherous conditions. Officials have warned the elderly to stay at home. At least seven people have died due to the weather - the two latest victims were homeless people in Barcelona. The temperature plunged to -25C (-13F) in Molina de Aragón and Teruel, in mountains east of Madrid - Spain's coldest night for at least 20 years. Deep snow left by Storm Filomena has turned to ice, disrupting transport. There has been an extraordinary quantity of snow and ice for Spain, where winters are usually quite mild. 'Spanish Siberia' Molina de Aragón, where the coldest overnight temperature was recorded, is 197km (122 miles) north-east of Madrid. It lived up to its nickname, "the Spanish Siberia". "We're going to have this cold for a few more days, but we all pull together," local woman Yoli Asensio told the BBC's Guy Hedgecoe."Day-to-day life is difficult," she added. "There's so much snow about, the access to homes and roads is blocked. Some older people have had falls." Besides the two deaths in Barcelona, at least five others are known to have died due to the cold: two in Madrid, two in Málaga and one in Zaragoza. The overnight temperature in Madrid itself fell to -16C, and on Monday the capital's hospitals - already under great pressure because of Covid-19 - struggled to cope with patients who had slipped on the ice, breaking bones. Medical sources told El Mundo daily that there were 1,200 fracture cases on Monday in the Madrid region's hospitals, caused by accidents on the ice - an average of 50 an hour. The flood of emergency calls prompted the Madrid government to appeal to the elderly to stay at home. A power cut caused the suspension of the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail link, but the service has resumed now, Spanish media report. Many commuter train services were also disrupted by the extreme weather. Flights were suspended at Madrid-Barajas airport at the weekend, but they have gradually resumed, albeit with a big backlog and delays. Spain's El País daily says the danger posed by icy road conditions has prompted what it described as "a titanic effort, what could almost be compared to a dystopian reality". The paper reports that 1,300 snow-clearing vehicles are now operating and in 24 hours they managed to push snow off 12,100km of roads, to keep them ice-free.
Why virtual team-building activities feel agonising | A group of colleagues is standing in two rows, arms outstretched, waiting to catch their co-worker. They’re playing a trust game, and the man in question is currently dithering at the edge of a raised wooden platform. “I’ll go first,” he says, rather more confidently than he seems. Nothing happens. “Can I ask you… Are you going to catch me?” he half-jokes, half pleads. Oh yeah, they murmur together. Finally, he throws caution to the wind. His rigid body plunges onto their arms. As he falls, it’s already clear that this is not going to plan. There’s an unnerving amount of shouting. Their tight-knit structure is beginning to break up. One woman, positioned at the front, leaps away, apparently realising she doesn’t want to be the sole person to break his fall. He hits the ground, headfirst. Great teamwork, folks! This is something of a 'team-building' worst-case scenario, of course. But, nevertheless, these two words stoke fear and loathing in the hearts of many – the wholesome outdoor activities, the games that require you to physically touch your colleagues, the cruel flashbacks to the most embarrassing aspects of childhood, from school sports days to rounds of “two truths and a lie” that inevitably end up offending someone. Arguably the most heinous team-building events involve 90s clichés such as trust falls, pseudoscientific personality tests and brain teasers. One example is the famous chicken-and-fox puzzle, which actually dates back to medieval times and was immortalised by the British TV series The Office: a farmer needs to get a fox, a chicken and a sack of grain from one side of a river to the other, but his boat can only carry one at a time. How can he achieve this, without ending up with a feathery bloodbath or an empty sack? Answers on a postcard, please. But modern equivalents can be just as unappealing. There are the bizarre: luges have become popular team-building events, and one man reportedly attended a forklift truck derby for his. Next are the awkward: some Russian ‘banyas’ – nude bathhouses – are advertising themselves as suitable for groups of colleagues. And some are downright perilous: blindfolded driving, anyone? If you’re really unlucky, team building can provide a rare opportunity for your most extroverted co-workers to showcase their improv skills. Could anything be less fun? Yes, as it turns out. Amid the pandemic, companies are increasingly in need of ways to keep their teams focused and maintain a sense of cohesion;  as of March, many will have spent almost a whole year working remotely. So as everything else has moved online, including hiking trips and haircuts, team building has followed suit. But this has brought its own problems. Whereas at least before the activities involved might have included a day ‘off’ work or a weekend away, now they entail yet more time at your desk, glued to your computer screen. As millions battle Zoom fatigue and – oddly – even longer working hours than before, virtual team building is arguably even more agonising than the real thing. It’s also inherently flawed. Physical experiences are more bonding Kieron Bowen, sales director at Eventurous, a team-building and corporate-events company based in the UK, says the pandemic has had a radical impact on the activities they can provide. Ordinarily, the business relies on providing experiences such as GPS treasure hunts, crystal-maze challenges and soap-box derbies (a kind of gravity-powered car race popular in the US). Whereas at least before the activities involved might have included a day ‘off’ work or a weekend away, now they entail yet more time at your desk, glued to your compute “They’re challenges that the teams take on together in a physical sense,” he says. Some of their activities are more obviously aimed at bonding colleagues together, like classic psychometric testing, but others use more organic, less structured methods, such as encouraging teams to work together in a competitive environment against the clock. Since Covid-19, the company has been forced to focus more on events that can be done via video calls, like virtual escape rooms. During these live-hosted events, companies start with a background story – “so that there’s a bit of emotion and a bit of theatre”, says Bowen – and then task contestants with a series of puzzles that need to be solved within a set time frame. But it’s much harder to achieve the same level of bonding when you’re not physically together; in the virtual world, there’s less scope for the unexpected or unpleasant to happen – things that you can recall later and giggle about. And this means it’s unlikely to be as good at forging a sense of solidarity. In a 2018 study, groups who consumed raw chillies or did upright wall squats – painful experiences – had more supportive interactions among team-members and heightened collective creativity, versus those who were just asked to eat hard-boiled sweets or balance on one leg. So, as infantilising as organised fun seems, it can provide the opportunity for teams to experience mutual hardships that could strengthen connections, such as struggling through bad weather together, or even experiencing team-building #fails like dropping a colleague on their head (though not recommended). When ‘fun’ feels like work Effective team building is thought to require two things. The first is a change of scenery, which makes the activity seem more like a break and less like a continuation of your normal day. The second is a demonstration that your employer genuinely cares about your wellbeing – and perhaps the feeling that this is the purpose of the task. These principals were discovered by the researcher who is often credited with inventing the very concept. Elton Mayo was an Australian psychologist based in Illinois, who conducted his research at the Western Electric Company in the 1920s and 30s. He suspected fatigue and monotony was affecting the efficiency of the workers, and wondered what could be changed to relieve it. To find out, he set up an experimental room at the factory, and spent years siphoning employees off in small groups to investigate the impact of different conditions, from lighting to breaks. When Mayo analysed his results, he found something surprising: no matter what he did, the productivity of the workers improved. Crucially, Mayo realised that the participants were responding to the fact that he was changing their environment full stop – what those alterations were was relatively unimportant. Instead, the benefits that he was seeing were down to the fact that they were revelling in being studied, which made them feel special, like their employer was making these adjustments for their own benefit – though in reality, they were aimed at maximising productivity. And most importantly, the experiments provided colleagues with a shared identity and opportunity to interact It’s nearly impossible to provide specialised attention on a group video call to make people feel like they matter But virtual team-building fails spectacularly at both of Mayo’s central tenets. First, it’s nearly impossible to provide specialised attention on a group video call, to make people feel like they matter. And if you’re attending a team-building video chat from the same place as your regular meetings, it’s hardly going to feel like a change of environment. Bowen agrees that it’s important that team-building activities don’t feel like work – and even he concedes that “it’s very difficult to replicate that in a virtual medium”. The whole concept is controversial Another school of thought is that virtual team building isn’t the issue – it’s the entire concept of these activities that’s fatally flawed. Some experts are sceptical about the efficacy of any kind of ‘fun’ team building that’s not strictly relevant to a team’s set of job descriptions. Bill Critchley, an organisational psychologist based in London, says the evidence shows that ‘simulated development’, such as outdoor trust falls, doesn’t actually transfer from that forest back to your meeting room. So, attending a forklift truck derby with your colleagues or watching your teammates mix cocktails in front of their cameras might help you to forge new connections in the moment – but unless you happen to work on an industrial site or at a bar, these experiences won’t necessarily help you later. Critchley explains that team bonding is inherently tied to the context it occurs in. When you arrive back at your desk the next day, the inherently political and complex nature of the workplace means people “revert to their normal way of behaving”. Critchley gives the example of a “major retailer” he once worked with. “They had a number of away days and they really improved dramatically,” he says, citing their ability to work together, communicate and address big issues. “I thought we'd done the job. I then went and then attended one of their normal everyday meetings...” In their usual context, they had returned to the dynamic they had before. “They all kind of raised their eyebrows and said, ‘yes, we know, Bill, we're doing it again.’” In place of doing activities, Critchley usually works by taking to each member of a team to find out what their issues are and where they came from. Then, he’ll meet them for a day to observe their realities first hand, and develop ways for them to do things differently. Finally, he follows up to make sure everyone is sticking to their promises. However, the delicate choreography involved in even this brand of team building is – like every other kind – harder to achieve in a virtual environment. “It’s to be avoided,” says Critchley, speaking of all such online activity. “Because human beings resonate with each other physically in the room, that’s how empathy works – at least they can feel how they're going to impact on each other. That important dimension is missing, virtually.” A break from trust falls So, is all online team building pointless? Bowen argues these activities have their place, as long as businesses feel like they’re fulfilling their goals, and they can find a way to make them genuinely enjoyable. “We know virtual events aren’t quite the same as in-person events, and so do clients,” says Bowen. “I think when the circumstances and restrictions allow, the majority of clients will revert to in-person away days and events.” Not many people will tell you this, but the unpalatable truth is that not many team development exercises actually work – Bill Critchley In the meantime, the challenge is to simulate the tactile, physical experience of a team-building day trip, from the comfort of a home office. “We organise virtual cocktail-making masterclasses and cookery classes,” says Bowen, “we send out a load of equipment and consumables in a box to the delegates pre-event, and then we set up a studio and stream an experience with a baker or chocolatier or mixologist.” This may be the reason why those Zoom birthday parties and lectures spent sitting in the same desk chair you do all day fall short.   Meanwhile, Critchley is not quite so confident. “Not many people will tell you this, but the unpalatable truth is that not many team development exercises actually work,” says Critchley. “A lot of facilitators love developing really complicated exercises, and everyone quite enjoys them because they feel they're doing something, but I'm afraid they don't work.” No matter which side you’re on, there be may be one upside we can all agree on: no one is going to be expected to trust fall into their colleagues any time soon.
Husband on leash breached Quebec's Covid curfew | A couple in Canada have been fined for breaking Covid curfew rules after the woman was caught "walking" her husband on a leash, according to local media. The woman reportedly told police that she was just out "walking her dog" near their home in the city of Sherbrooke, in Quebec province. On Saturday the province imposed a nightly curfew between 20:00 and 05:00. Walking a dog close to home is one of the only acceptable reasons to be outside between those times. The pair were spotted by police at around 21:00 on Saturday, just a short while after the new rules came into effect. They reportedly told police that they were following the rule for pets. Isabelle Gendron, of the Sherbrooke Police Department, told the local newspaper La Tribune the couple "did not co-operate with the police at all". They were each fined CA$1,546 ($1,212; £893). Police across Quebec issued 750 tickets for violations during the first weekend of the curfew. Canada has seen a recent surge in Covid-19 infections, nearing 670,000 total cases since the pandemic began. On Monday Quebec's premier François Legault called on residents to respect social distancing rules, saying "I know it's difficult, but Quebeckers are able to work as a team when necessary." He warned that the situation in the province's largest city Montreal was "really critical" and said hospitals were nearing the point where they would not be able to treat all patients.
Florida manatee with 'Trump' etched on back prompts investigation | US wildlife authorities have launched an investigation after a manatee was discovered with the word 'Trump' scraped on its back. The marine mammal was spotted on Sunday in Florida's Homosassa River, with the US president's surname on its body. Officials told AP news agency that the animal does not appear to be seriously injured, and the word was scraped onto algae growing on its skin. But a video of the West Indian manatee has led to public outcry. Manatees, nicknamed "sea cows," are protected under US law, and anyone found guilty of harassing them faces up to a year in prison and a $50,000 (£37,000) fine. Images of the animal was first shared by the Citrus County Chronical, a local newspaper, and have been widely shared on social media. Investigations into the incident are being led by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The Centre for Biological Diversity, a conservation charity, is also offering a $5,000 for information leading to the conviction of those responsible. "It's heartbreaking that this manatee was subjected to this vile, criminal act," said Jaclyn Lopez, the centre's director, in a statement to local media. "It's clear that whoever harmed this defenceless, gentle giant is capable of doing grave violence and needs to be apprehended immediately," she added. The manatee is a large, slow-moving mammal which has become an unofficial mascot for Florida. There are around 6,300 currently in the state, according to the USFWS. They typically gather in warmer waters around the state during the winter time as temperatures drop. However their numbers have fallen in recent years due to habitat loss, algae blooms and strikes by fast-moving boats. They are also vulnerable to attacks by humans while they congregate in the shallow water of local rivers and canals. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, 637 manatees died in 2020, 90 of which were victims of boat collisions. Another 15 were killed by other interactions with humans.
Lisa Montgomery: Judge halts execution of only woman on US death row | A US judge has granted a stay of execution to Lisa Montgomery - just hours before the only woman on America's federal death row was due to be given a lethal injection. Judge James Hanlon said a competency hearing should be held first. Montgomery's lawyers had argued she was mentally incompetent to be executed, saying she was born brain-damaged. Lisa Montgomery strangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. Montgomery, now 52, would have been the first female federal inmate to be put to death in almost 70 years had her execution in Terre Haute, Indiana, gone ahead as scheduled on 12 January. Looking for answers in the life of a killer. What did the judge rule? In Monday's ruling, Judge Hanlon of the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana wrote: "Ms Montgomery's motion to stay execution is granted to allow the court to conduct a hearing to determine Ms Montgomery's competence to be executed. "Ms. Montgomery's current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government's rationale for her execution. "The court will set a time and date for the hearing in a separate order in due course," Judge Hanlon wrote. Montgomery's attorneys welcomed the ruling. "The court was right to put a stop to Lisa Montgomery's execution," attorney Kelley Henry said in a statement. "As the court found, Mrs Montgomery 'made a strong showing' of her current incompetence to be executed. "Mrs Montgomery has brain damage and severe mental illness that was exacerbated by the lifetime of sexual torture she suffered at the hands of caretakers," the attorney added. Prosecutors have filed a notice to appeal the judge's ruling, CNN reports. Can Montgomery escape death penalty? It is the second time that Montgomery's execution has been postponed. Her execution date was originally set for last December - but a stay was put in place after her attorneys contracted Covid-19. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year. There are suggestions that Montgomery now may even escape the death penalty entirely, as President-elect Joe Biden - who is due to take office on 20 January - has said he will seek to end federal executions.
WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms | Message platforms Signal and Telegram have both seen a huge surge in downloads around the world following a controversial change in WhatsApp's terms and conditions. WhatsApp has told its two billion users they must allow it to share data with its parent company Facebook if they wish to continue using it. The change does not apply to users in the UK and Europe. However, the notification has been sent to everyone. All WhatsApp users will be unable to continue with the service unless they accept the new terms by 8 February. WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe Both Telegram and Signal also offer free-to-use encrypted messaging services. Signal strength According to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, Signal was downloaded globally 246,000 times the week before WhatsApp announced the change on 4 January, and 8.8 million times the week after. This included big surges in India, where downloads went from 12,000 to 2.7 million, the UK (from 7,400 to 191,000) and the US (63,000 to 1.1 million). In a series of tweets, Signal said some people were reporting issues with creating groups and delays to verification codes arriving because of the rapid expansion but that it was solving the issues. "Our new servers are ready to serve you," it said on 10 January. It also received endorsement from Tesla co-founder Elon Musk, who tweeted "use Signal" on 7 January. Telegram has proved even more popular, with downloads booming globally from 6.5 million for the week beginning 28 December to 11 million over the following week. In the UK, downloads went from 47,000 to 101,000. And in the US they went from 272,000 to 671,000. During the same period, WhatsApp's global downloads shrank from 11.3 million to 9.2 million. Even so, one industry watcher said he did not think this necessarily represented a big problem for WhatsApp, which has been downloaded 5.6 billion times since its launch in 2014. "It's going to be difficult for rivals to break user habits, and WhatsApp will continue to be one of the world's most popular and widely used messaging platforms," said Craig Chapple, mobile insights strategist at Sensor Tower. "It'll be interesting to see whether this latest trend sticks, or users revert back to what they know." WhatsApp has said the data it will share with its parent company will not include messages, groups or call logs. However, it will include: phone number and other information provided of registration (such as name) information about the user's phone, including make, model, and mobile company internet protocol (IP) addresses, which indicate the location of a user's internet connections any payments and financial transactions made over WhatsApp It said its policies were in line with "applicable" privacy laws.
Silencing Trump: How 'big tech' is taking Trumpism offline | If you ever needed proof of the power of "Big Tech" then the downfall of Parler on Monday morning is a good place to start. I, like many others, logged on to the controversial social network to see what would happen after 11:59 Pacific Time in the US. This was the deadline Amazon had given the app to find a new host service before it booted the platform offline for allegedly containing violent content. It was being seen as a significant moment in ongoing efforts by US tech giants to "deplatform" Donald Trump and some of his extreme supporters after the US Capitol Hill riot last week. Trump’s Twitter downfall The clock struck 12:00 though and nothing happened. I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual. But then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. With a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now. Parler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.Technology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons. "Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas," she said. It's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too. Again, this is not unheard of. Gab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days. And as part of a crackdown on accounts associated with the attack on Congress, on Monday Twitter announced it has shut down "more than 70,000 accounts" linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Facebook meanwhile said it was removing all content mentioning "Stop the Steal" - the slogan associated with Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the November election was rigged. 'Problematic' ban What is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president. Since Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch. YouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance. European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as "problematic". EU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as "the 9/11 moment of social media", writing in Politico that "the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing". UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now "taking editorial decisions", adding that platforms were "choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice". Elsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship. He tweeted: "The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship." Covid changed social networks The fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter. One of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse. Platforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders. In March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation. It wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence. The president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: "When the looting starts, the shooting starts". Social media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets "a pivotal precedent" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post. Trump vows to fight back Some analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide. On Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election. Privacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. "Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally." In his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for "banning" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post. Many argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do. US President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news. In the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with "various other sites" and that there would be "a big announcement soon". If the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media.
European doctors running low on drugs needed to treat Covid-19 patients | Hospitals across Europe could run out of the drugs needed to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients within a week, the European Commission has warned in a letter obtained exclusively by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Patients who are severely ill with coronavirus require critical care. When put on a ventilator they can need up to 50 different medicines, including those for intubation and sedation, as well cardiac, respiratory and antimicrobial drugs. The most critically ill patients can stay on a ventilator in intensive care for several weeks. It presents a two-fold challenge for hospitals, with a higher number of patients needing ventilators for longer, meaning more medication is required. The surge in demand for drugs means that stocks in many hospitals are running low, and pharmacists are increasingly unable to replenish supplies. This is forcing hospital staff to use unfamiliar drugs or alternatives, some of which could lead to heavier sedation. There are fears that this could mean more people suffer poor outcomes, including ICU delirium, a life-threatening condition where patients suffer delusions and hallucinations, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stella Kyriakides, the EU’s commissioner for health and food safety, wrote to pharmaceutical companies at the beginning of April asking them to increase production of the medicines needed to care for patients with the virus, the Bureau can reveal in the first of a series of stories highlighting the fragility of the world’s drug supply chain. She wrote: “The Commission will continue to closely engage with you on finding optimal solutions for the challenges at hand. We count on you to discourage unethical commercial behaviour.” There is an “imminent risk of shortages of critical hospital medicines used to treat Covid-19 patients” The letter, obtained by the Bureau, shows that there are already shortages of drugs including sedatives, painkillers, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials needed to treat patients with Covid-19 in Spain, France, Sweden, Portugal, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovakia, Ireland, Austria, Czechia and Malta. Shortages are anticipated in Italy, Belgium, Germany, Croatia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Liechtenstein, Finland, Greece, Cyprus and Estonia. Last week, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the Intensive Care Society, the Association of Anaesthetists and the Royal College of Anaesthetists released new guidance for frontline staff in the UK on how to manage the rising demand for critical-care medications during the pandemic. It includes advice on how to conserve drugs by administering them differently or switching to alternative products. Greg Barton, chair of the UK Clinical Pharmacy Association’s critical care group, warned that the pandemic will throw anaesthetic practice “back 20 years” because low nursing numbers mean patients will require heavier sedation in intensive care. He warned that the medications used for deep sedation – midazolam and morphine — are linked with PTSD and delirium, a condition that can lead to cognitive impairment and early death. “In normal days, we would try to have the patient as alert and awake as possible,” Barton told pharmacists in a webinar about critical care practice. Oversedating patients means that they stay in intensive care and on ventilators for longer, and are more likely to suffer pneumonia as a result, alongside other poor outcomes. A lack of drugs has become a “limiting factor” in the care of Covid-19 patients, on top of ventilator and personal protective equipment shortages, the European University Hospital Alliance said in a letter sent to national governments at the end of March. “It is extremely worrying that overworked and often less experienced nurses and doctors-in-training, drafted in to fill the gaps, have to use products and dosages that they are not used to,” the Alliance said. Several countries have banned the export of critical-care medicines to conserve them for domestic use. The Alliance has called on countries to keep drug supply chains moving so that medicines can reach the patients that need them. A co-ordinated European response would be necessary if studies showed that drugs such as antimalarials or antivirals are effective against Covid-19, it said. While “green lanes” – priority channels for the transport of essential goods such as medicines – have been introduced at border crossings throughout Europe, some manufacturers report that they are operating in fits and starts. Transportation issues are also still a problem for drug makers. In her letter, Kyriakides reiterated that there is an “imminent risk of shortages of critical hospital medicines used to treat Covid-19 patients”. She asked the pharmaceutical industry to increase production of the necessary drugs with “extreme urgency”. The list of medicines in short supply was compiled from information provided by the industry to the European Medicines Agency. The agency is working on a broader list of essential drug shortages beyond those used to treat Covid-19 patients.
UK purchased £1bn of beef from firms tied to Amazon deforestation | The world’s biggest supplier of burgers has been fuelling the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by sourcing cattle from ranches linked to deforestation – and British companies are still buying thousands of tonnes of its beef. Marfrig, a Brazilian meat company that has supplied McDonald’s, Burger King and other huge fast food chains around the world, bought cattle from a farm using deforested land in a part of the Amazon currently ravaged by forest fires. One of the key causes of those fires is farmers clearing land for eventual beef pasture. The company boasts of its green credentials and recently offered $500m in bonds aimed at environmentally conscious investors. Marfrig claims that none of the cattle it buys come from farms involved in deforestation and that it is the only beef company that can guarantee this. Yet research by Repórter Brasil, working with the Bureau and the Guardian, traced cattle that the company purchased this year back to a farm that had grazed cows in an area of illegally felled rainforest. Our investigation has also revealed the full extent of the UK’s involvement in the Amazon crisis. Nearly £1bn worth of beef supplied by Marfrig and two other meat giants which have been accused of deforestation — Minerva Foods and JBS — was directly imported to the UK in recent years. Unprecedented research to be published today claims that the supply chains for exported beef from these three companies are between them linked to up to 500 square kilometres of deforestation every year. Brazil sent 1 million contaminated chickens to the UK in two years Responding to our findings, Neil Parish, MP, chair of the Commons environment, food and rural affairs select committee, said: “This investigation shows the importance of supply-chain transparency, from farm to fork. We must think more carefully about the environmental impact of food and the greater degree of control we have with British made products. I’m sure British consumers will not want to be contributing to deforestation in the Amazon.” Bill McKibben, the veteran environmental campaigner, told the Bureau: “It’s hard to know what's worse — companies that don't acknowledge our environmental crisis at all, or those that … do so and then don't live up to the promises they make.” In January, inspectors from Ibama, Brazil’s environmental watchdog, found cattle from Limeira Ranch grazing on illegally deforested land inside a protected region, the Triunfo do Xingu Environmental Protection Area in Pará state. The region has been devastated by the largest number of forest fires in Brazil this year. The land where the cattle were found had been placed under an official embargo — which prohibits grazing — three years before, due to illegal felling. Embargoes are imposed for environmental violations and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover. For breaking the embargo, the ranch was fined R$ 1.19m ($300,000) this year. Despite this, documents obtained by Repórter Brasil show that 144 cattle from Limeira Ranch were subsequently supplied to a Marfrig abattoir in Tucumã, also in Pará. The company also bought cattle from the ranch on multiple occasions in late 2018. There is no evidence that the cattle Marfrig purchased were raised on illegally deforested land. In response, Marfrig did not dispute that the ranch had broken an embargo at the time of the purchase, but said that official checks it carried out using Ibama data at the time had given the ranch the all-clear. A spokeswoman for Marfrig said: “Ibama issued a negative certificate assuring that on that date nothing was against the supplier … That’s the only way companies — not just Marfrig — can look for official information in real time.” The company added that it had stopped buying from the ranch as soon as it learnt of the fine. According to documents seen by the Bureau, Ibama had publicly listed the fine on its website two weeks before the cattle purchase. Ten years ago Marfrig committed “not to purchase any livestock originating from deforested or conservation areas”, and said in 2017 that it was tightening up its protocols for cattle purchases, adopting a system that “blocks, rather than permits, cattle purchases in the case of any doubts”. This July Marfrig launched a controversial “transition” bond designed to tap into the growing sustainable investment market. Like “green bonds”, which allow environmentally friendly firms to raise cash, bankers have designed transition bonds for companies with the potential to clean up their practices to fund that change. However, there is no single definition of a “sustainable transition”. Experts have suggested that the absence of minimum standards could leave the bonds open to exploitation by greenwashers – businesses seeking to exaggerate their environmental commitments. Joshua Kendall, senior environmental analyst at Insight Investment, said that while the Marfrig bond showed credible sustainable objectives and a commitment to improvement, he had not invested. In his opinion, “it doesn't go far enough beyond ‘business as usual’ spending. It also lacks indicators that would give us a sense of whether or not it has made improvements,” he said. Limeira Ranch is not the only deforestation case that can be linked to Marfrig. According to new figures from Trase — a supply-chain initiative run by the Stockholm Environment Institute and NGO Global Canopy — Marfrig’s beef exports could be linked to up to 100 square kilometres of deforestation a year in Brazil. Trase also calculated figures for JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, and Minerva Foods, another large global supplier of Brazilian beef. JBS beef exports could be linked to up to 300 square kilometres of deforestation per year, and Minerva Foods linked to up to 100 square kilometres, the research says. JBS and Minerva both said they did not buy cattle from farms in deforested areas and that they had systems in place to block non-compliant suppliers. The Trace research mapped supply chains for beef from international markets back to the specific areas of Brazil where the cattle were raised. By cross-referencing these chains with official data on new pastures, deforestation and cattle numbers, the researchers calculated a potential deforestation “risk” — presented as an area in sq km — associated with companies and even specific international markets. Overall, up to 5,800 sq km of forest — an area four times the size of Greater London — is being felled in the Amazon and other areas annually to be converted into pasture used for cattle farming, according to the Trase report. How it ends up on your plate The Bureau has established that Marfrig, along with Minerva Foods and JBS and their subsidiaries, has shipped at least 147,000 tonnes of beef to the UK in the past five years – enough to make 170m burgers a year. That much meat is worth £1bn. Much of it was canned corned beef destined for supermarkets and other retailers, as well as frozen meat imported for wholesalers and manufacturers. From there it could end up in hospital dinners, ready meals and fast food, through a chain of little-known catering and food production companies. The Bureau has identified several of these chains, including one that ends with the Ministry of Defence. Brazilian canned beef from Marfrig or JBS has been found by the NGO Earthsight at Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl and Asda. The Bureau has also found JBS-produced canned beef at the Co-op. That can was marked with a stamp showing the beef had come from Brazil. But the link is not always so clear, and it can be impossible for consumers to always know if their food is from companies linked to the destruction of the Amazon. JBS canned beef is also sold to NHS Supply Chain, which manages the sourcing and supply of food across the health service, including at hospital trusts. Weddel Swift, part of the Randall Parker Food group, is hardly a household name, but it supplies meat products to caterers, wholesalers and retailers. The company has bought £30m worth of Brazilian beef since 2015 from Minerva. The group told the Bureau that only 1.5% of its sales had come from Brazil and that it has only imported £240,000 worth of beef this year. Weddel Swift also said it believes Minerva is a responsible beef producer. Earthsight discovered that beef from Minerva was being supplied to the Ministry of Defence, but the department could also be feeding soldiers JBS beef as well. Vestey Foods, which holds the catering contract for Armed Forces personnel on active deployment in the UK, buys Brazilian beef from JBS. The MoD said it did not directly contract with Minerva or JBS, and added that it was working with suppliers “to address any concerns surrounding the recent link between sourcing beef from Brazil and deforestation.” It is impossible to trace specific cans of Brazilian corned beef or a supermarket cottage pie directly back to fields burned out of the Amazon rainforest. Many retailers insist their supply chains contain only sustainable beef, but continue to bolster the profits of businesses which have been linked to deforestation. Toby Gardner, the Trase director, said that all those involved in the Brazilian beef chain needed to act: “Buyers, whether traders, processors, retailers, need to demand and invest in transparency systems that can guarantee they are sourcing from areas that have not been recently deforested, whilst at the same time working to support producers' shift to more sustainable and at the same time more productive systems.” In a statement to the Bureau, Minerva Foods said: “100% of Minerva’s purchases come from zero-deforestation areas ... Our sustainability department blocks any suppliers that are not compliant ... which effectively means that Minerva can’t buy any animals coming from these suppliers.” The company also said all of its cattle procurements were completed after checks on the supplier ranches using public government databases on embargoed areas. It said it has blocked more than 2,000 cattle suppliers who were found not to be in compliance with standards. JBS told us: “We have a zero deforestation policy in the Amazon and prohibit cattle from deforested farms in the region from entering our supply chain ... To date, more than 7,000 potential suppliers have been blocked from our system.” They added that a recent audit found 100% of their cattle purchases were in compliance with their responsible sourcing policies. Responding to the findings on behalf of supermarkets Aldi, Sainsbury’s, Asda and The Co-op, Leah Riley Brown, of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Illegal deforestation is completely unacceptable, and retailers are collaborating to tackle deforestation and drive greater uptake of certified sustainable products in their supply chains.” Burger King said: “Our goal is to eliminate deforestation within our global supply chain, and we are working toward this” and that all their suppliers were required to comply with their sustainability and forest protection policies. McDonald's said it aimed to eliminate deforestation from its global supply chains by 2030 and that it had “made a commitment not to purchase raw material from any farm in the Amazon ... linked with deforestation”. NHS Supply Chain said: “We are committed to procuring products responsibly and sustainably and actively work with our suppliers on important issues such as sustainability.”
How is government using big data? The Bureau wants to find out | AI, algorithms, deep learning, big data - barely a week goes by without a new revelation about our increasingly digital future. Computers will cure cancer, make us richer, prevent crime, decide who gets into the country, determine access to services, map our daily movements, take our jobs away and send us to jail. Successive innovations spark celebration and concern. The UK should be “ready, willing and able” to profit from the economic potential of being a world leader in the artificial intelligence industry, a recent government report emphasises. Academics and civil society, meanwhile, sound warnings over corporate accountability, the intrusiveness of personal data and the ability of legal frameworks to keep pace with technological challenges. These concerns become particularly acute when it comes to the use of digital technology by the public sector, which is compiling ever larger datasets on citizens as it moves towards an increasingly digitised future. But how this is happening is still a huge unknown. Questions abound about what national and local governments are already doing with data, who they are paying to do the work, and what the potential outcomes could be, especially for society's most vulnerable people. Attempting to shed some light on those questions is of clear public interest. As such, the Bureau has been looking at this area with a view to launching it as an investigative theme. We started by undertaking a six-month scoping exercise, examining what IT systems the government is buying. In a report out today, ‘Government Data Systems: The Bureau Investigates’, we release our initial findings. Our report looks at how to use publicly available data to build a picture of companies, services and projects in this area. We trawled through official transparency data, scraped websites, dug into big datasets, and made dozens of freedom of information requests to public authorities. We also interviewed experts, insiders, academics and members of civil society. Government IT contracting is a flourishing sector. We found more than 1,800 IT companies selling short-term contracts to government, and almost 300 providing more complex services. The Home Office's plans to become a “data-driven organisation” have required work by more than 40 companies in just the last two years, our research revealed. What it didn’t reveal, however, was precisely what all these companies are working on, or why they were hired in the first place. From start to finish we encountered systemic problems with disclosure, despite the UK's claim to lead the way in open data. Transparency - and therefore accountability - over the way in which public money is spent remains a grey area. This should ring alarm bells. The state is in the midst of a complex data-driven revolution predicated on saving money through major digital transformation programmes. But its citizens often remain in the dark about what the changes will entail and who is being paid to carry them out. Development of algorithmic and data-driven systems is frequently predicated on austerity - doing more with less. The adoption of such systems, the combining of legacy databases and the roll out of “digital by default” services is a major driving force in public policy. Information technology contracting for government is a flourishing area: although still dominated by traditional big names, many lesser known companies are also offering a wide variety of services. The Home Office’s ambitious plans for new data-driven systems have required the assistance of over 40 companies in just the last two years. We traced several types of government purchasing activities for digital systems, finding over 1,800 companies selling simpler or shorter-term consultancy, software and storage services and almost 300 providing more complex requirements. Many authorities were unwilling or unable to specify how and why they purchased these services, however, or what their precise specifications were. Public authorities - national and local - are supposed to keep transparent and accessible records of the services they purchase (in part to comply with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015). We found that this was rarely the case. Government transparency datasets are an inadequate tool for understanding purchases, particularly in the case of highly diverse large companies which offer a multiplicity of services (true of many major government contractors). The UK lags massively behind the US’s granular approach to public spending available through the Federal Procurement Data System, for example. Transparency - and therefore accountability - over the way in which public money is spent remains a very grey area in the UK. This is concerning, particularly at a time when the state is driving a complex data-driven revolution predicated on saving money through major digital transformation programmes and legacy system overhauls.
How clean water can be the most powerful weapon against superbugs | Above one of the doors of the Mirigu health centre in the Upper East Region of Ghana, the words "labour ward" are written in black marker. In a cramped room no more than a few metres wide, midwife Felicia Akansi delivers about 15 babies every month, and staff members treat hundreds of patients for conditions as minor as a cough to seriouus diseases like malaria. The health centre has been busier than ever since it got running water last year. There can be severe shortages of water at rural health facilities like this - but the same cannot be said for antibiotics. Even facilities without running water on site have a steady stream of antibiotics to give to patients, with the drugs readily available and widely used to treat infections often spread by unhygienic conditions. The more antibiotics are used, the less well they work - but the more they are again prescribed. It's a vicious cycle that means bacteria are growing ever more resistant. About half of patients in Ghana's biggest hospital are prescribed antibiotics, compared with a third in hospitals in Europe. Although data is limited for rural health care facilities like Mirigu, studies suggest that the drugs are given out in even higher rates here. Only a handful of hospitals have labs to test whether a patient actually needs antibiotics, and many people self-medicate, buying them over the counter. As bacteria become resistant to common drugs, stronger antibiotics are in short supply, and without these, doctors are faced with infections they simply cannot treat. The Bureau has been investigating the growing antibiotic resistance crisis for the last two years. The overuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture has hastened this process, and experts now warn of a looming global crisis. But in many developing countries, the crisis has already hit. "When you have health care-associated infections from poor sanitation or poor infection control, you have all these readily available drugs given to patients to cure them. Now, when you have resistance to these drugs, there's nowhere to run," said Dr. Emmanuel Irek, a microbiologist at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria, who has studied resistant infections across Africa. Even at bigger district hospitals, doctors have a limited arsenal of drugs to call upon, Irek said: "We have the relatively cheaper ones, such as cephalosporins and macrolides [two classes of antibiotics], but when we now talk about resistant bugs, which invariably are due to poor infection prevention and control and poor water, sanitation and hygiene, we don't have the best antibiotics to deal with them." One in three health care facilities in low and middle-income countries doesn't have readily available water, according to the World Health Organization. In poor, rural areas like Mirigu, this figure can double. Instead, vats of water are filled for washing hands and instruments. There's no safe way to dispose of medical waste. "When you have resistance to these drugs, there's nowhere to run" It's a recipe for cross-infection, all largely solvable with running water. Until the nonprofit WaterAid put in the water supply at Mirigu a year ago, staffers would fill containers from a shallow borehole that would often run dry. Women with newborns would have to walk home to wash, often bloodied and carrying their soiled bedding. The recent installation of running water at the health centre has helped break the cycle of infection and has been a powerful weapon in the fight against growing antibiotic resistance. The toilet and shower blocks were finished last year, their bright blue walls distinguishing the new buildings from the old. Now, mothers can shower after labour, and patients can use a toilet that flushes and wash their hands with soap from the old plastic bottles next to each sink. There's also a new incinerator. Many rural health care facilities try to burn medical waste in shallow pits, but at Mirigu, it can now be safely disposed of, further reducing the risk of infections spreading. "Now, when they come, they feel happy and safe," midwife Akansi said. "It's made a big difference, a very big difference. I think it has reduced - and it will even reduce more - infections in the health care facility." Although awareness of antibiotic resistance among patients remains relatively low in developing countries, word can spread quickly that conditions in a health facility have improved, meaning more patients seek care. One study from a district hospital in Sierra Leone reported that more than half of women who had caesarean sections would contract sepsis, a potentially deadly bacterial infection of the blood. After the operating theatre and labour ward were fitted with a better water supply and lighting and staffers were trained on proper hygienic practices, cases of sepsis dropped to less than 1 in 10 women. Within six months, deliveries at the hospital doubled as patients quickly learned that the services at the maternity unit had improved. "We can only be as strong as our weakest link. Antibiotic resistance doesn't respect any borders." A global problem Antibiotic resistance is a growing global crisis that will hit the world's poorest people hardest. Estimates show that 10 million people a year will die worldwide from the effects of superbugs by the middle of this century. Four million of those deaths will be in Africa unless radical action is taken to deal with the problem. Efforts to improve sanitation and hygiene in Ghana's health sector are part of wider plans to slow the growing threat of superbugs. It is one of only two countries in West Africa to publish its action plan to tackle antibiotic resistance, a target set by WHO for all member states to deliver by the end of 2018. Many more countries are still developing plans, despite the deadline having passed. "We can only be as strong as our weakest link," said Mirfin Mpundu, head of ReAct Africa, an organization helping governments, including Ghana, produce action plans to tackle antibiotic resistance. He explains how the constant coming and going of people allows disease to spread easily from country to country. "Antibiotic resistance doesn't respect any borders." Experts say wholesale interventions are needed to stem the rising tide of resistant bacteria, from global efforts to discover new antibiotics to local ones like improving microbiology labs so they can test for resistance. But for many people around the world - like those living in Mirigu - tackling the problem starts simply with safe, clean water.
The rapid rise of phone surveillance firms | Since the Snowden revelations of 2013 most people have become used to the idea that American and British intelligence agencies can find out anything about anyone. And as debate grows about the influence of the tech titans – companies whose earnings exceed the gross domestic product of some countries – many people are similarly unsurprised at the scale of data accumulation by the likes of Google and Facebook. But the idea that a huge proportion of our mobile phone interactions are vulnerable to surveillance by a broad array of actors around the world, on account of longstanding weaknesses in the SS7 signalling system, still draws shock. “The government is fixated on kicking specific vendors like Huawei out of our networks,” said Blake Reid, telecom law professor at the University of Colorado. “But there are decades-old, gaping holes in our overall telecom security architecture that this focus on vendors has no hope of addressing.” The situation, he said, leaves some security researchers and consumer advocates “incredulous”. In a joint reporting project with the Guardian, the Bureau found that phone operators in the Channel Islands, and elsewhere around the world, were being used for surveillance purposes by corporate intelligence firms. We found evidence of phone intrusions in more than 60 countries, including the UK, the US and almost every country in Europe. And we found that such intrusions are able to track the locations of phone users as well as, in some circumstances, intercept their messages, calls, and other sensitive data. The answer lies in the rapid evolution of the telecoms industry. Up to the 1990s, the sector was made up of a handful of phone companies – many of them state-run – which grazed peacefully in an atmosphere of mutual trust, with little need to authenticate the provenance of the communications that flowed between them. That has since been disrupted by privatisation: now hundreds of mobile operators, large and small, compete for subscribers and traffic. Virtual operators, which can offer competitive roaming or data deals without the expense of owning and maintaining their own infrastructure, also piggyback on network access along with numerous peripheral players offering services such as bulk SMS delivery for marketing and authentication. For this system to function, companies need to trade access to global phone networks – a trade that leaves them open to exploitation by other actors. Not all countries have highly developed surveillance infrastructure and expertise. For many, it is more convenient to contract the job out to the private sector. And a flourishing marketplace for such services has emerged, as evidenced in revelations about the activities of Hacking Team, NSO Group, Circles and Candiru, among others. Surveillance-as-a-service is not limited to government clients: at the lower rungs of the business, some providers offer individual buyers basic phone tracking in exchange for bitcoin on the dark web. But the top end of the market is dominated by private companies contracting for states – some of which have a long history of internal repression and rights abuses. Underlying this high-end surveillance market is what appears to be a wide-ranging penetration of global phone networks. The Bureau’s investigation found evidence of surveillance traffic emanating from access points in the Channel Islands, the US, Iceland, Switzerland, Israel, Cameroon and Laos – to name a few. A recent report by the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, a research group focused on digital threats to civil society, said that SS7 signalling abuse is arguably more insidious than notorious hacking software such as NSO Group’s Pegasus, since it generally leaves no trace on a device for forensic analysis. The abuse of SS7 vulnerabilities for phone hacking was first disclosed in 2014 by Tobias Engel and Karsten Nohl, but experts told the Bureau that the industry has been slow to mitigate burgeoning security threats. Regulators sometimes seem surprised – with Guernsey’s telecoms authority telling us in response to our findings that “this is the first time [we have] been made aware of these issues” – while others appear reluctant to intervene. In May 2018, the Oregon senator and privacy advocate Ron Wyden said the US Federal Communications Commission had “done nothing but sit on its hands, leaving every American with a mobile phone at risk”. Responding to the Bureau’s findings this week, he reiterated his criticism, stating that the outgoing FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, “has shown no interest in protecting Americans from foreign spying”. “​Surveillance of individuals has been shown to lead to arbitrary detention, sometimes to torture and possibly to extrajudicial killings​” The UK has taken a more active role in trying to stem the tide of surveillance incursions into the country, with a new law drafted to beef up the security obligations of phone operators and the enforcement powers of the regulator. As we discovered, however, this risks leaving a major gap unplugged in the shape of Britain’s offshore enclaves. Again and again, experts told us that such gaps are ripe for exploitation by surveillance companies acting on behalf of undisclosed clients. Although some of the market for phone surveillance revolves around state-on-state espionage, the risks of unstemmed abuse of the SS7 network extend to its use as a tool of internal repression. This concern was highlighted by David Kaye, former United Nations’ special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, who reported last year that “surveillance of individuals – often journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others exercising their right to freedom of expression – has been shown to lead to arbitrary detention, sometimes to torture and possibly to extrajudicial killings. Such surveillance has thrived amid weak controls on exports and transfers of technology to governments with well-known policies of repression.” A rule change by the European Union has made it harder for EU countries to export surveillance tech to places where its use might entail human rights concerns. But as our investigation shows, the extent of phone network vulnerabilities means that such moves are unlikely to be effective unless accompanied by stronger action from phone companies and tougher oversight from regulators. At present, however, there is effectively no transparency on how much malicious traffic passes through the world’s phone networks on a daily basis. Individual phone users have no means of telling whether they have subscribed to a network with strong security provisions or to one with a history of failing to block unauthorised messaging. Citizen Lab’s recent report offers a bleak assessment of the worldwide effects of an untrammelled surveillance market: “spaces for legitimate democratic activity will continue to shrink” and “governments’ ability to protect their citizens, as well as their own essential services and national security, will also continue to erode”.
She split up with a cop. Then he had her arrested | At 2.45am one night in 2016, Tracy's father was woken up by torch lights darting around his garden. Then there came an urgent thumping on the front door. He went downstairs to find police officers on his porch. They were looking for Tracy. They said they wanted to arrest her for harassment. “I’d sent something like 10 messages in seven days,” Tracy, whose name has been changed, told the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. She had been texting her ex-partner, an officer with Greater Manchester Police (GMP), because he had not been allowing her any contact with their young daughter. When the police called at her parents’ house, Tracy was in fact staying with her sick grandmother more than 50 miles away. So the following night, officers from GMP paid that house a visit instead. They arrested Tracy just after midnight. Her grandmother collapsed soon after and had to be seen by paramedics, Tracy believes due to shock. It was not the first time Tracy had been arrested, she said. It was the latest in a series of incidents that she feels her ex-partner had sought to orchestrate, using his position as an officer with GMP, to intimidate her by getting her in trouble with police. She sees this as a form of coercive control only available to a police officer. “I believe his use of the law and the system, and his knowledge of police procedures, has made him able to do things, and the police have taken him more seriously because he was a police officer,” Tracy said. When she once threatened to report her ex-partner to the force over concerns about his behaviour, she said he replied, “I am the police”. Tracy feels some police officers responded to her ex-partner’s allegations against her with undue severity because he was a police officer. She said she was arrested 10 times in four years. Two of these occasions led to convictions. The force found that he had given “factually incorrect” information, knowing it would likely lead to her arrest, but said he had no misconduct case to answer GMP later failed to take disciplinary action against him, she believes. The force found in a misconduct investigation that he had given “factually incorrect” and incomplete information to courts and to police, knowing it would likely lead to Tracy's arrest, but the force said he had no misconduct case to answer because he had not been acting in the course of his job as a police officer when the events occurred. The Victims’ Commissioner, Vera Baird, said GMP’s reasoning was not acceptable. “Stories such as this one bring the police into disrepute,” she said. “It is breathtaking that victims in this position are often sure, as this one is, that they have been treated badly by police for complaining against one of their own. They see their adversary protected, as in this case, where the police hierarchy failed to impose even a disciplinary penalty... A victim has nowhere else to go for help but their local police force.” Tracy's story follows the Bureau’s reporting on the experiences of those abused at home by police officers. Multiple women told us their abusive officer partners had misused their professional positions to further intimidate or harass them. Accounts included the stalking of an ex-girlfriend in a marked police car; threats of police loyalty and getting the women “put in prison”; and provoking and then recording the women at home, suggesting it would later be used against them. Nearly 100 women from around the UK have come forward to share experiences of domestic abuse by partners in the police. In an attempt to force action, lawyers from the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) have launched an official “super-complaint” about forces’ handling of such allegations, covering all forces in England and Wales. The complaint, which police regulators are now investigating, calls for changes in forces’ procedures, such as appointing another force to investigate allegations and automatically bringing in the Independent Office for Police Conduct for oversight. There is no suggestion Tracy reported her ex-partner to any police force for domestic abuse. Yet she feels his use of legal and policing systems against her was a form of emotional abuse – only available to a police officer – from which she is only now starting to recover. The Bureau shared her case with CWJ’s lawyers who in turn alerted the Greater Manchester deputy mayor for policing, Bev Hughes. She told us she had raised concerns with GMP’s chief constable and that discussions about the case were ongoing. Hughes said she had also asked GMP to review the wider issues raised in the nationwide super-complaint and that the force has since developed a detailed action plan in response. “Retrospective examination of criminal investigations has also taken place to scrutinise investigations, decision-making and to identify any learning that can be done,” she said. “I am very clear that allegations of police perpetrated domestic abuse must be effectively and appropriately investigated, just the same as for any other member of the public. I understand that Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary will commence an investigation into the super-complaint shortly and I welcome that investigation.” Tracy told the Bureau her saga began in 2013 when she and her ex-partner were still together. “He called me a ‘fat bitch who couldn’t even get having a baby right’,” she said of an argument after their daughter’s premature birth. “So I slapped him across the face. He rang the police because he said I needed teaching a lesson.” GMP arrested her for the first time and kept her in a cell overnight, then released her with no action, she said. “That was the beginning of hell, a situation I thought I would never get out of.” The couple split up and their young daughter lived with her father. Soon after, Tracy said, she was served with her first court order. “At 6am there was a knock on the door, and a man from the court handed me a ‘non-molestation order’,” Tracy said. It transpired her ex-partner had taken the injunction out against her, and it meant she could be arrested if she contacted him. “I went to a solicitor who said we’d challenge it. But in the interim I sent him a message saying ‘I’m sorry, please let me see [my daughter]’, because he was withholding her,” she said. “A week later there was a knock at my mum and dad’s door at 7am and it was the police to arrest me for it.” This, Tracy told us, set the pattern for her ex-partner’s behaviour: in her view misusing his legal and policing knowledge to emotionally abuse her by getting her in trouble with the police. Over the following six months, she said, she was arrested four more times on his reports to the police of her breaking the injunction. “What woman separated from her baby wouldn’t look at a piece of paper and break it to see her baby?” Tracy said. “I don’t believe any woman on Earth wouldn’t break it.” Two of these arrests led to her spending the night in police custody. “Twelve hours. That was a long, long time,” she said. She got so used to time in police cells that she would take some books to read, she said, but this did not eradicate the “feelings of panic, like the walls are closing in”. A few years later, her ex-partner’s pattern of behaviour started all over again. When he was looking after their daughter he would block Tracy's contact with her, so she would text and email him. He would then report her to GMP for harassment, without telling the police why she was contacting him. “Before ... I had a good flat, a good job, a good social life, then my life was turned upside down.” This led to the 2.45am visit to Tracy's parents’ house, and the midnight arrest at her grandmother’s home the next day. The police de-arrested her that night when she said she could not leave her sick grandmother; when she voluntarily attended a police station the next day, they arrested her again. She spent eleven hours in custody before being released with no further action. Tracy told us she never thought she would end up in a police cell. “Before ... I had a good flat, a good job, a good social life, then my life was turned upside down,” she said. “I just felt hunted.” She described how her self-esteem was eroded and she had no voice to push back on the injunctions or allegations being made against her. “I had police and social services all saying ‘you are the abuser and [your ex-partner] is the victim’.” She said she felt they were publicly saying they understand coercive control but not looking adequately at the evidence in this instance. She was in constant fear of the police and said at times she felt suicidal. “Eventually I got to the point where I thought I’m either going to die or I’m going to have to stand up for myself,” she said. “So I started writing the police letter after letter.” Tracy’s letters of complaint led to GMP undertaking an internal misconduct investigation. The resulting report stated that her ex-partner had twice failed to tell the police, when reporting Tracy for harassment, that she was contacting him because he had not let her speak to their child. It also said he had “failed” to tell this to a court in a sworn statement, when successfully applying for a second injunction against Tracy for harassment. The report found that Tracy's ex-partner would have been aware, “with his knowledge of police procedure” that withholding key information from both the court and police would most likely lead to her arrest.
Underage vaping spikes in the north of England | More than a fifth of 15-year-olds in Yorkshire and the Humber vape, according to NHS figures that suggest a stark north-south divide in underage vaping. The data – based on a survey of 13,000 children produced after inquiries by The Bureau – found that teenagers in Yorkshire were more than three times as likely to vape regularly as those in London. Vaping has long been understood as a powerful tool in helping smokers quit, but with big tobacco companies spending billions getting e-cigarettes to market there is concern among campaigners and activists that these products could get a new generation hooked on nicotine. In the US more than one in four high school students regularly vape. In the UK, Public Health England has consistently said that relatively few teenagers vape. However the Bureau's research suggests that national data figures fail to recognise local hotspots. The majority of 15-year-olds in Yorkshire and the Humber have tried e-cigarettes. Almost 10% vape at least once a week, and another 12% vape occasionally. Separate figures produced by councils in Yorkshire highlighted the potential risk of teen vaping “hotspots” hidden in the national figures. A survey of 1,800 pupils aged 14 and 15 in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, found that 11% vaped at least once a week. The northwest of England also has significantly higher underage vaping rates than the south, with 6% of 15-year-olds vaping at least once a week. In Blackpool, a local authority survey of children aged 14 and 15 revealed that 8% used e-cigarettes weekly and almost half had tried them. In comparison, less than 3% of 15-year-olds in London and the southeast are regular vapers, according to the NHS-commissioned Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Among Young People survey. Public Health England – which recommends e-cigarettes, also known as vapes, as a tool for quitting smoking – insists that regular vaping among young people “remains low”. Experts, however, believe the true figures could be higher than surveys suggest. Dr Jennifer Quint, a reader in respiratory epidemiology at Imperial, fears that both the national and local surveys’ methodology may be causing a massive under-reporting of youth vaping. “I suspect there are a lot of places that are just as bad … but you don’t have the data to support it,” she added. Paediatricians have previously said they fear the number of UK children who vape is being “grossly under-reported”. Dr Arif Rajpura, public health director for NHS Blackpool, said vaping could help smokers to quit, but is concerned that it could potentially lead to a new generation becoming addicted to nicotine. “We don’t want young people who have never smoked to start a new form of addiction,” he said. Rachel Brown, a researcher at Cardiff University who has studied youth vaping, said: “The data shows young people who are trying e-cigarettes first are doing so because they found e-cigarettes easier to get hold of.” Brown added: “Vaping is something that is very much centred around the social group. Where the experimentation happens it is almost always with peer groups and it is often the case that one person would turn up with a vape and everyone would try it.” Vaping has divided the UK’s public health community. Professor Andrew Bush, a paediatrician specialising in respiratory disease, is concerned about the long-term impacts of vaping. “It took 30 or 40 years before we realised the damaging effects of tobacco,” he said. “We are sitting on a potential time bomb with all these kids getting hooked on this stuff.” John Britton, a professor of epidemiology and director at the UK Centre for Tobacco & Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, does not believe youth vaping is a critical issue. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received reports of 26 serious respiratory reactions to vaping. In total, there have been five cases of patients dying from potentially e-cigarette-related illnesses. By contrast, smoking is believed to be responsible for 80,000 smoking deaths each year in England. “Nobody I know in tobacco harm reduction has ever argued that vaping is safe,” said Britton. “We just argue that it is not as harmful as smoking and the level of risk is orders of magnitude less than smoking.” When contacted by the Bureau about discrepancies in regional vaping data, Public Health England made no comment on that issue, but Martin Dockrell, the head of tobacco control, noted: “The research in the UK consistently finds some young people experiment but regular vaping among those who have never smoked is very rare and youth smoking rates continue to decline at an encouraging rate.”
Half of UK chickens produced by US agriculture giants | Half of the UK’s chickens are being produced by companies fully or partly controlled by US agribusinesses, according to an analysis of industry data, fuelling concerns of growing American influence over the British food sector. Moy Park, owned by Pilgrims Pride, now produces approximately 312 million birds a year, while Avara Foods – a joint venture between the US giant Cargill and the UK’s Faccenda Foods – slaughters 234 million. About a billion birds are killed every year in UK abattoirs. The growing US presence on British chicken farms has been accompanied by growth in American-style intensive farming. A Guardian and Bureau of Investigative Journalism investigation has found that the number of large intensive farms in Britain has risen by a further 7% in the past three years, despite previous assurances from the government that the UK would not adopt US farming practices. In 2017, Michael Gove, then the environment secretary, said: “One thing is clear: I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country”. He was responding to the Guardian and Bureau’s revelation that there were almost 800 intensive farms in the UK that would fulfil the US definition of a “megafarm”: a unit housing 125,000 chickens raised for meat, 82,000 laying hens, 2,500 pigs, 700 dairy or 1,000 beef cattle. Gove's comments escalated into a row with Liam Fox, then a fellow Cabinet member, over whether US hygiene standards – such as washing chicken in chlorine – would be deemed acceptable to secure a trade deal after Brexit. Many of the megafarms revealed in the 2017 Bureau investigation were supplying chicken to supermarkets and major fast food chains. Some are known to have supplied Moy Park and Faccenda Foods. Megafarm is not an official term in the UK, where the largest regulatory classification is “intensive” – housing at least 40,000 poultry birds or 2,000 pigs grown for meat or 750 breeding sows. These industrial facilities require a government permit to operate. According to data obtained by The Guardian, the number of industrial sized poultry and pig units requiring a permit has risen by 7% since 2017 from 1,669 to 1,786. The vast majority of these are chicken farms. Almost 90 more permitted intensive farms have opened in England since 2017, and 20 more are operating in Wales. Intensive cattle farms do not currently require a permit, although about a dozen feedlot-style beef units are known to operate in the UK, alongside about 70 intensive dairies. Industrial-scale farms are controversial because they require keeping tens of thousands of animals in a small space. Campaigners and independent experts say this can hamper natural behaviours, such as nesting. The US poultry industry has a chequered record on food safety and animal welfare. Advocates maintain, however, that megafarms and intensive farms take up much less space and allow animals to be kept securely away from predators and potential carriers of disease. Conditions are tightly controlled, allowing farmers to monitor the amount of daylight, water and feed for the animals, and if disease develops the livestock can be treated quickly. They are much cheaper to run than traditional farms. Gary Ford, from the NFU said: “British farmers already operate to some of the highest animal welfare and environmental standards in the world and it’s crucial we recognise that animal husbandry and stockmanship are the greatest factors that determine animal health and welfare, not farm size or system of production.” Uncertainty over farming subsidies post-Brexit and increased demand has forced farmers to diversify, particularly into poultry farming. “This is an attractive industry for both existing farmers and new entrants to move into,” he said. But Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming said the increase is due to decades of encouragements to factory farm, farmers hooked on subsidies and distorted markets: “The reality is that farming animals isn’t a big profit maker for farmers, who have been relegated to commodity servants to big food corporations, producing at or below the cost of production. Hooked on a treadmill, some see getting bigger and more intensive as their only hope.” Dominated by a handful of companies, the US poultry industry is vertically integrated, with big businesses tending to control almost all of the production chain, from hatching the chicks and producing the feed to owning the slaughter and processing plants. UK businesses now operate a similar model. Pilgrims Pride, which was set up by the Pilgrim brothers 70 years ago, is an iconic symbol of industrialised US agriculture. In 2009 a majority stake in it was bought by the Brazilian JBS corporation, which has been accused of profiting from Amazon deforestation, but Pilgrims Pride is still headquartered in Colorado and operates under American regulations. Some US poultry companies have been accused of exploiting contract farmers, with farmers allegedly pitted against each other for payment based on the weight and health of their animals. Several chicken companies recently successfully lobbied the Trump administration to waive limits on factory line speeds at some poultry slaughterhouses, raising concerns over food safety, bird welfare and injuries to employees. There is evidence that at least one UK firm recently sought to increase its line speeds. Animal welfare activists have suggested higher line speeds mean live birds have to be hung for slaughter at breakneck speeds, raising the risk that birds could be fully conscious at the moment of slaughter.
Prisoner risk algorithm could program in racism | A new algorithmic tool for categorising prisoners in UK jails risks automating and embedding racism in the system, experts and advocacy groups have warned. The tool draws on data, including from the prison service, police and the National Crime Agency, to assess what type of prison a person should be put in and how strictly they should be controlled during their sentence. Critics told the Bureau that the new system could result in ethnic minority prisoners being unfairly placed in higher security conditions than white prisoners. This would exacerbate long-standing problems of discrimination exposed in an excoriating review two years ago by the Labour MP David Lammy. Higher category prisoners have fewer opportunities to develop skills and work towards rehabilitation compared with those held in open or lower security jails. Responding to the Bureau’s findings, Lammy said: “This new information paints a damning picture of a criminal justice system that problematises people based on the colour of their skin. “The way in which offenders are categorised has a huge impact on the opportunity they have for rehabilitation.” A preliminary evaluation of the new system by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), obtained by the Bureau via a Freedom of Information request, concluded that there was no indication of discrimination. But experts have questioned whether the MoJ’s findings can support this conclusion. The evaluation, completed in August 2018, assessed an initial trial on 269 prisoners, of whom 32 were black, Asian or from an ethnic minority (BAME). Although some numbers were redacted from the report, the Bureau’s analysis indicates that 5 of the 32 non-white prisoners — 16% — had their risk category raised under the new system, while 7%, or 16 of 230 white prisoners, did. The evaluation highlights an inherent risk of the new tool – that potential racial bias already present in the prison system “may translate into more reporting on BAME prisoners through our intelligence systems.” Because the tool relies on these systems, “this may result in a greater proportion of BAME prisoners having an increase in their security category”. Despite this warning, the MoJ concluded that the data in the trial showed that “there is not an adverse effect in terms of BAME offenders being negatively categorised” and “no evidence of discrimination”. However, when challenged by the Bureau, the MoJ admitted the trial sample size was too small to judge the impact on prisoners of different ethnicities. The tool’s reliance on intelligence sources, and the MoJ’s assessment of its findings, have provoked criticism. Patrick Williams, a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University and a specialist in disproportionality within the criminal justice system, criticised the use of intelligence to inform categorisation. “It’s remarkable that in the context of this report the MoJ claims there is no evidence that BAME prisoners are at risk of discrimination,” he said. “Intelligence-informed categorisation will simply take police intelligence into the prison environment and may result in presenting BAME people as more risky to prison staff. This in turn will increase surveillance and offender management. To suggest this tool will not have a disproportionate effect ignores all available evidence.” Tanya O’Carroll, director of Amnesty Tech, likened the new tool to the Metropolitan Police’s “Gangs Matrix”, which is being overhauled following an investigation by the Information Commissioner, after it was accused of being systemically racist and unfit for purpose. “These kinds of systems are premised on the idea that police intelligence data can be a neat, objective measure of how likely someone is to offend or re-offend,” she said. “In practice, the story is very different … At the same time, the algorithm gives these systems a veneer of being more scientific, more objective, even as they become harder to interrogate.” The MoJ refused to specify which intelligence systems the new tool used, claiming this information “would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of security and good order”. Documents obtained by the Bureau suggested that the tool’s data sources would soon be expanded, stating that “[prison] staff welcomed the additional information that the tool provides, but were keen to see further integration of the process into existing prison IT systems”. The new system was first announced by the former justice secretary David Gauke in July last year. He claimed the tool would provide a better assessment of whether offenders were involved in organised crime. He said: “This new £1 million investment will allow us to extend the use of digital categorisation to the rest of the prison estate within 12 months, so that all offenders will be sent to appropriate prisons.” Since then, the MoJ has given little public indication of progress, although a spokesman told the Bureau the trial had been expanded to include eight prisons. The new system is part of a broader austerity-era pattern, in which private contractors team up with government departments to streamline services by harnessing the power of data. A report by the Bureau in March revealed both the scope and scale of recent investments in data-driven systems, along with systemic issues of transparency and accountability around how they are purchased and developed. The digital prisoner categorisation tool was first developed by Deloitte, which won a tender in December 2017 to “identify possible methods to automate the categorisation and allocation of prisoners decision-making process, and improve data sharing across the criminal justice system”. The goal included “developing a more data rich process ... aligned to the MoJ objective of becoming a more data-driven department.” The MoJ advertised a follow-on contract in November 2018, but cancelled it after they decided to continue development of the tool in-house. In March the department told the Bureau that it was testing a second version of the tool, with the aim of rolling it out more widely later this year. But this month it declined to comment on how far this had progressed, saying merely it was still being tested. The lack of transparency has caused alarm. Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “The categorisation system is certainly in need of an overhaul, and there are some sensible aspects to what has been trialled. But the risks are significant, especially around race. “Given what we know about entrenched discrimination in the criminal justice system even before someone goes to prison, it is more likely than not that a categorisation system relying on confidential intelligence will entrench or even exacerbate that unfairness. So it is crucial that the prison service is completely transparent about every stage of its evaluation.” The MoJ emphasised that the new tool “is intended to support categorisation decisions, rather than make them” and staff would be expected to use their judgement when using the results provided by the algorithm. The pilot report found that “in 20 cases staff have, based on other evidence and sources of information, rejected the provisional security category suggested by the tool”. In some cases the pilot found that prisoners who could be managed in open prisons were being recategorised upwards to closed C-category prisons. On review, the MoJ determined that this was unnecessary and would be revised in the next version of the tool. The report emphasised that “the audit capabilities enabled by the tool will improve our ability to promote equality of outcome”. The government is grappling with two competing commitments: tackling systemic problems in the justice system; and cracking down on disorder in prisons. In almost his first act as prime minister, Boris Johnson reaffirmed David Gauke’s pledges in August, ordering a review of sentencing and restating the intention to create a further 10,000 prison places. Simultaneously, however, the MoJ is struggling to address the results of the Lammy review, which David Liddington, Gauke’s predecessor as justice secretary, admitted in December 2017 offered a “sober analysis of discrepancies in how people of different backgrounds experience the criminal justice system”. At that time, the government committed to adopting the mantra of “explain or change” — understanding and tackling disparities across government institutions. Implementation of this principle has not been straightforward, however. When the justice select committee reviewed progress on Lammy’s recommendations in March, it highlighted the persistent and ingrained nature of race inequalities in the justice system and the lack of concrete outcomes to address them. Campaigners working in the criminal justice system questioned the extent to which the MoJ was addressing Lammy’s findings in its new initiatives. The findings around the digital categorisation system “show the importance of all new and future Ministry of Justice policies being properly equality impact assessed to ensure they do not further exacerbate the alarming levels of disparity in the criminal justice system,” said Jess Mullen, head of policy and communications for Clinks, the infrastructure organisation for the voluntary sector in criminal justice. Simon Creighton, a partner at London law firm Bhatt Murphy, described categorisation as “absolutely critical” for prisoners, but warned that cuts to legal aid had “effectively removed legal oversight” from the process. He said that while legal challenges to categorisation “used to be quite routine” they were now only carried out in a “tiny minority of cases sufficiently egregious to warrant judicial review” “The effect is that decisions that might be on the wrong side of the balance are not challenged,” he said. “If soft information is added to the equation, particularly undisclosed and unchallenged ‘intelligence’ material, there is a real risk that decisions will be unreliable and unfair.” The MoJ said that prisoners could access the justification for all decisions made and could appeal their categorisation. It emphasised that one black prisoner included in the assessment had been recategorised downwards. A spokesman added: “The new tool will actually give us data we don’t currently have that will help us better identify and rectify inequalities, as well as using evidence more effectively to keep the public safe.” In his 2017 report, Lammy warned that as technology evolved, “the nature of scrutiny will need to evolve too”. “New decision-making tools, such as algorithms, are likely to be used more and more in the coming years – for example, to assess the risk individuals pose to others,” he wrote. “If and when this happens, the criminal justice system will need to find new ways to deliver transparent decision-making.”
What is big data? | The world is filled with devices that record our activities: our locations, associations, purchases and conversations; our likes and dislikes, our entertainment choices, our physical activities, our desires and our fears. All this data, which we create simply through the act of living in a networked, digital world, has value: to advertisers wanting to sell to us, to insurance companies wanting to assess our risk, to politicians competing for our votes. Increasingly, it also has value to government departments as they try to decide who to provide services to, or withdraw opportunities from. Governments have long used statistics to make predictions. What’s new is the availability of precise, detailed information about so many aspects of our lives, coupled with the ability of computers to trawl through massive amounts of material and extract previously unknown insights. The ability of machines to process vast amounts of data and “learn” from it has brought artificial intelligence out of the science fiction novel and into our living rooms – as well as into the corridors of power. To date, much of the reporting on these developments has focused on the US. But the growth of data-driven systems is increasingly a worldwide phenomenon. Two years ago Theresa May, then the prime minister, promised a new industrial strategy that would “put the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and data revolution”. This revolution “will disrupt nearly every sector in every country, creating new opportunities and challenges for people, places and businesses to which we must respond”. In Europe, Asia and the Global South the effects of the revolution are already starting to be felt — effects which we intend to scrutinise in our new project. Falling costs of computing power and storage, coupled with lower budgets for services in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the years of austerity which followed, have accelerated the adoption of digital technology in government. Authorities hope that this will enable them to make better decisions more efficiently and more cheaply. But experts warn that this brings with it fundamental shifts in the balance of power between the state, corporations and the individual. It also highlights disparities of production and consumption between the developed and the developing world. The term “digital” might create an impression that all this technology is virtual, non-physical. But everything happens somewhere. Big data requires lithium extraction in Bolivia, hardware assembly lines in China and toxic e-waste disposal in Ghana. It demands electricity production sufficient to power enormous cloud storage systems, complex supply chains spanning dozens of countries to create and distribute its equipment, and outsourced labour to perform all of these tasks. The era of big data is an era of big questions. Who owns the data? Who controls it? Who makes money from it? How is it processed, and who is affected by that? These questions are not just technical, but geopolitical, economic, environmental and ethical. As the data revolution takes root around the world, the public interest demands that the media, as well as academics, engineers, civil society and politicians, start to grapple more comprehensively with its complex effects.
Balinese temple monkeys are sophisticated thieves | IF YOU visit Uluwatu temple in Bali, beware. The long-tailed macaques there are well-known thieves. Since time out of mind they have made a living by robbing tourists of their possessions and then holding those objects hostage until a ransom in the form of food is paid. That is quite clever. But Jean-Baptiste Leca of the University of Lethbridge, in Canada, wondered whether these monkeys are cleverer still. Sometimes, they do not accept the first offer and hold out for more. He therefore asked himself whether they are able to assess how valuable an object is to its owner, and factor that into their negotiations. Laboratory experiments conducted in the past with various species of monkey and ape suggest such primates can indeed attach a value to something intrinsically worthless to them, like a coloured plastic counter, by learning that tokens of this sort may be exchanged for food, and that different types of token bring different rewards, not all of them equally valued by the animal (a desirable grape versus an undesirable piece of cucumber, for example). That, though, is an artificial protocol in an artificial setting. The macaques of Uluwatu are true wild animals, albeit ones that are familiar with, and comfortable in the presence of, human beings. As they describe in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Dr Leca and his colleagues conducted their experiment by wandering around the temple for 273 days with video cameras, recording the activities of the larcenous monkeys. Every time they saw a monkey show interest in a particular tourist, they recorded the interaction. Not all attempts at robbery were successful. But of those that were, they analysed the details of almost 2,200. To work out what was going on, they had first to establish the relative values of food rewards to monkeys, and of stealable objects to people. The temple staff keep three sorts of reward available for use by tourists who want to get their property back: raw eggs, bags of fruit and crackers. Different monkeys have different preferences, but Dr Leca and his colleagues established these for individual animals by offering them choices between pairs of goodies in a preliminary experiment. To confirm which stealable objects are most valued by people, they divided them into six classes: empty containers, such as phone cases, camera bags and plastic bottles; accessories such as hairpins and key rings; hats and headgear; shoes; spectacles and sunglasses; and electronics and wallets (phones, cameras, tablets, purses and so on). They then observed, from their video recordings, how often victims bothered to bargain with the thief for the return of property of different classes, and thus classified objects into low value (the first two classes on the list), medium value (the second two) and high value (the third two). They found that monkeys do, indeed, have a sophisticated sense of what they are doing—at least, adults and sub-adults do. They have a preference for stealing high-value items, and will hold out either for more rewards, or for better ones, if they are in possession of such items. But this is something that they have to learn as they grow up. Juveniles make no such distinctions. In monkeys, as in people, guile is a trick that has to be learned.
From the universe to the dataverse | America’s biggest spread of silicon for turning photons into power sits in the Mojave desert about 100km north of downtown Los Angeles. The Solar Star facility consists of 1.7m solar modules on 13 square kilometres of land. On sunny days it can feed more than half a gigawatt into the grid. In a nice inversion of the old solar-booster’s saw that the Sun provides enough energy in an hour to power civilisation for a year, Solar Star provides enough energy in a year to power civilisation for about an hour. Such installations are changing the world. Other photon-driven technologies, those concerned with the gathering and transmission of information, have already done so. Five-and-a-half hours’ drive north-west from Solar Star, at a national laboratory in Silicon Valley called slac, you can find the world’s biggest spread of silicon for turning photons into information. It consists of 189 specialised chips arranged in a disk about 64cm across which will occupy the focal plane of the world’s largest digital camera. Over ten years it will produce a database in which the positions and behaviours of hundreds of billions of celestial objects will be stored. This array is remarkable in various ways, including its size, the fidelity of its electronics and the precision of its alignment. But in its essence is not that different from the heart of a 1980s camcorder. Just as it is possible to produce a chip with millions of transistors on it, it is possible to produce a chip with millions of photon receivers on it. Fitted with the right lenses and mirrors, such chips can take pictures. Later this year the array now at slac will be shipped to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a new facility in the Chilean Andes named after an American astronomer who pioneered research into “dark matter”. There light from distant galaxies will bounce off the three mirrors of the observatory’s telescope and pass through three huge camera lenses so as to form a pin-sharp image on the array’s perfectly flat 189-chip surface. On each of those chips sit 16m “charge-coupled devices” (ccds), each containing a p-n junction where incoming photons can knock loose electrons. Each time a far-flung photon does so, the liberated electron is stored in a tiny capacitor. During the 15 seconds of a typical exposure some of these capacitors will store dozens of electrons. Some will store none. At the end of the exposure, each of the array’s 3.2bn ccds will pass its electrons on to the element next door like a string of emergency workers passing sandbags. Circuits at the end of the sandbag line will count the electrons from each element, and use their number to establish the brightness of the corresponding pixel in the resultant 3.2 gigapixel image. These images will contain 50 times more data than those produced by the best digital cameras used in cinema. They will capture patches of sky 40 times the apparent size of the Moon at a level of detail that would pick out a golf ball 25km away; the faintest of the millions of things seen in each frame will be 25m times fainter than the dimmest stars that can be seen with the naked eye. But single frames are not enough. The telescope will scan the whole sky every few days for a decade, producing hundreds of images of every part of it. Comparing each new image with its predecessors will reveal celestial change: bodies moving, brightening, vanishing. Unusual changes will need to be swiftly followed up to see if they reveal something fundamentally new, which means data must be got off the mountain as fast as possible. That will be done with photon-based technology as remarkable, in its way, as the ccd array—but as ubiquitous as the great camera is unique. The information that comes into the observatory as a drizzle of photons from the far reaches of the universe will leave it encoded on a stream of photons pulsing down an optical fibre. A Chilean outfit which provides connectivity for science and education, reuna, gets the data from the observatory to Santiago. Another data-service provider, Ampath, provides a link to Miami using either an undersea cable in the Pacific or one in the Atlantic, depending on traffic. From Miami the data flash to slac. If the software which checks for changes sees something exciting the world will receive breaking news from the most distant of elsewheres less than a minute after the relevant photons arrived at the camera. And while en route to and from California, the data will be surrounded within optical fibres by vastly more, vastly more mundane data travelling from person to person or from device to cloud. In terms of astronomy the Rubin observatory’s 60,000 terabyte database will be the biggest thing ever. In terms of the data that today’s world produces and moves around it is a drop in the ocean. Optical-fibre networks are the backbones of every national telecoms system; they connect six of the seven continents to each other and link the phone masts which serve billions of smartphones to the clouds where their data can be processed and stored. Big data can only be usefully big because these narrow highways provide so much data-transfer capacity. Through a glass, brightly The light which goes into those fibres is made in semiconductors. There are various sorts of device which can reverse what goes on in a photovoltaic cell, turning current into light by means of a p-n junction, though typically in a mixture of gallium and arsenic, rather than in silicon. The simplest, light-emitting diodes (leds), are increasingly used to illuminate the screens of televisions, computers and phones, as well as the rooms in which people use those devices. leds’ ability to make light without heat—unlike a star or an incandescent bulb—makes them much more efficient than a light based on a hot filament can be, and also much longer lasting. They have thus continued the trend, first discerned by William Nordhaus, an economist, for ever less of the cost of living to be spent on light, a significant and absolute gain in human welfare delivered through wave after wave of innovation. The light used in optical fibres mostly comes not from leds but from semiconductor lasers (of which more in the next chapter) that are built a bit differently; they squirt their light out along the plane of the p-n junction, which is to say out of the side of the chip. At the far end this light is met by a photodiode—a device like a ccd, but in which the electrons knocked free by the incoming photons are processed immediately rather than stored. Between them is a thread of glass of staggering transparency. When researchers began to wonder, in the 1960s, whether light shone through glass fibres could be used for communications the idea seemed more than quixotic. Even a thin layer of glass absorbs a fair amount of the light which passes through it; just half a centimetre of plate glass reduces brightness by 20%. The most transparent glass in the world, that used in endoscopes, was 200 times better—you could pass a light beam through a metre of it and only lose 20%. But that still meant that, over 20 metres, 99% of the light would be absorbed. If you fed all the photons with which the Sun provides the Earth into one end of such a fibre, every single one of them would be absorbed before they had travelled a kilometre (and the fibre would have vapourised, but that’s another problem). The one thing that the fibre aficionados had on their side was that no one had ever really tried to push the absorption barrier in glass, because glass rarely needed to be more than a couple of centimetres thick. Given good reason to try, what had seemed impossible was quite quickly achieved. In 1965 Charles Kao, a researcher at stl, a British telecoms company, set the bar for practical communication at a loss of 99% of the incoming light over a kilometre of glass: that is, performance 50 times better than endoscope glass. Within five years a researcher at Corning Glass, Donald Keck, had cleared that bar with a fibre which lost only 96% of light over a kilometre. The development was not exactly smooth. As well as technical hurdles there were cultural differences—telecoms researchers, mainly electronic engineers, did not understand glass, and glassmakers did not understand electronics. Though in retrospect the technology’s promise seems obvious, many in telecoms remained convinced that microwaves guided by metal tubing were the future of high-data-rate communications; Bell Labs sidelined its optical-fibre team for years. The economic downturn of the 1970s hit corporate investment plans. But by the early 1980s the technology was becoming good enough to compete with microwaves beamed from antenna to antenna. And in 1982 the break-up of at&t created a competitive market for long-distance telephony in America. The newcomers, with no legacy technology, went for optical fibres. In the mid-1980s a team at the University of Southampton developed optical amplifiers: stretches of fibre doped with erbium, a rare-earth element. If you pump energy into the erbium atoms through the side of the fibre, they will produce new photons when hit by those coming down the length of the fibre, boosting the signal. Such amplifiers made it possible to create optical fibre cables that could cross oceans. The first, tat-8, was laid in 1988. Its 280 megabit-per-second (mbps) capacity was ten times that of the previous link, which passed radio waves along coaxial cable. Some thought it would take a decade for the cable to fill up; it reached full capacity in just 18 months. Part of that capacity was a dedicated 1.5mbps link between cern, a European particle-physics lab, and Cornell University in upstate New York, one of the hubs of nsfnet, the scientific network which was then the backbone of the internet. That link made it possible for Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at cern, to demonstrate his ideas about “browsers” and “html” to American colleagues. tat-8 put the “worldwide” into the world wide web. From then on, optical-fibre capacity and the internet grew hand in hand. As computers have improved, fibre capacity has kept up. It follows what Jeff Hecht, the doyen of laser journalists, calls Keck’s law, after Donald Keck (see chart). The innovation is mostly at the ends of the fibres, rather than in the fibre itself. The Rubin observatory’s brand new system uses equipment from Infinera, an American company, which allows many different lasers with slightly different wavelengths to share the same fibre; “dense wave-division multiplexing” of this sort can now allow up to 80 wavelengths to be used at a time. Once content to send information in “symbols” of just one bit—dim the laser for 1, brighten it for 0—engineers now use systems in which the phase of the laser’s light (the rise and fall of its peaks and troughs) encodes information, too. Single symbols can now carry two or four bits of information, rather than just one. The latest transatlantic cable, Dunant, commissioned in 2020, contains 24 fibres and uses such tricks to carry 300 terabits per second—more than a million times what tat-8 could cope with. It was paid for not by a phone company, but by Google, and the tech giant plans to lay another in just two years’ time. This is how information, whether from TikTok or a distant galaxy, girdles the Earth. 
Some Google staff have formed a union. Will other techies follow? | "THE DECLINE of labour-union membership since the late 20th century across America and Europe has been worrying for those who fret about rising inequality. So, too, has the rise of the tech giants whose huge profit margins and soaring share prices threaten to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few rich shareholders. And so the news, on January 4th, that employees at Alphabet, the parent company of Google, have formed a trade union—a rarity at tech firms in Silicon Valley—was greeted warmly by many inequality-watchers. But whether unionisation in Silicon Valley will catch on, or will make much of a difference if it does, is questionable. Unionisation has so far made few inroads into most Silicon Valley firms. According to America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics, just 4.9% of the country’s 5.1m workers employed in “computer and mathematical” occupations—including software developers, programmers and systems analysts—were represented by unions in 2019 (see chart). This figure has remained flat for decades. Today only people involved in food preparation, sales and agriculture are less likely than Silicon Valley’s IT workers to have union representation. This is not surprising. The Valley’s coders and other office workers are well paid and enjoy perks such as free meals that most workers can only dream of. They also possess highly sought-after skills, so they can easily find work elsewhere if they chafe at their lot. Meanwhile, most lower-skilled jobs, such as work in the canteens that produce those free lunches, have been outsourced, meaning that the workers are ineligible under American law for collective-bargaining rights. Nevertheless, the founders of the Alphabet Workers Union say the company provides fertile ground for a new union, claiming the company’s executives think that “discrimination” and an “unethical working environment are working as intended, at the cost of workers with less institutional power”. They also claim that organised labour has already had some success at the firm. Alphabet’s practice of forcing its direct employees to use arbitration for claims of sexual harassment was ended after a strike in November 2018. And employee pressure, they claim, forced Alphabet to drop the company’s artificial-intelligence programme with America’s armed forces, as well as Project Dragonfly, a plan to launch a search engine in China that would be subject to Chinese-government censorship. The thought of growing unionisation in tech may excite some on the left. Some researchers have put forward the idea that the decline of unions is responsible for the drop in the “labour share”—the proportion of GDP accruing to workers in the form of pay and benefits—and the rising “capital share”, which accrues to shareholders. Higher levels of union membership could increase the workers’ share of output and therefore reduce inequality. However, the empirical evidence on this is mixed. Recent research by the Bank of England has found that a rise of ten percentage points in the rate of unionisation increases wage growth by around 0.25 percentage points a year. In other words, by not very much. Another paper by the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, finds only a weak relationship between unionisation and labour’s share of national income. Other economists suggest that widening profit margins, the result of shrinking competition in American product markets, may be a more important factor behind capital’s rising share of income. Moreover, the Alphabet Workers Union may well be an exception rather than the start of a trend. Although the new group announced its plans, to great fanfare, in an opinion piece in the New York Times, so far the group includes just 226 of Alphabet’s 140,000 employees, or less than 0.2%. Nor is the group immediately seeking ratification from America’s union regulator, the National Labour Relations Board, meaning that its members will have to wait to receive any collective-bargaining rights. And contrary to widespread hopes that technology could encourage unionisation—by making it easier for Google’s software contractors, Uber’s drivers, or Deliveroo’s cyclists to contact each other to organise, for instance—there is, so far, little evidence for this."
What is the economic cost of covid-19? | The economic toll of the covid-19 pandemic is incalculable. But let’s try anyway. A useful starting point is the semi-annual Global Economic Prospects report released this week by the World Bank. It calculates that the world economy probably shrank by 4.3% in 2020, a setback matched only by the Depression and the two world wars. But this dramatic figure still understates the cost. It measures the world economy’s fall from where it was before the pandemic, not from where it would have been had the virus not spread. To calculate that bigger fall, economists need an estimate of how global gdp might have evolved in the absence of covid-19. One simple baseline is the World Bank’s projection released this time last year, when it was still blissfully unaware of the lurking viral threat. Back then, it expected global gdp to expand by 2.5% in 2020 to $86trn. Compared with that figure, the shortfall of global gdp last year was probably more like 6.6%. That is equivalent to about $5.6trn (at the market exchange rates and prices prevailing in 2010, which the bank uses for analytical convenience). In 2021 the world economy should grow unusually briskly, the bank projects, helped by the roll-out of vaccines. But even if this expectation is met and no further calamities intrude, the level of output in 2021 will remain 5.3% below the bank’s pre-pandemic projections: a further shortfall of almost $4.7trn (see chart).Put these two numbers together and the cost of covid-19 this year and last will amount to about $10.3trn in forgone output: goods and services the world could have produced had it remained unafflicted. That is, to put it mildly, a big number. Only America and China have an annual gdp greater than $10trn. And there are 153 economies that produced less than that between them in 2019. Converted into today’s money, $10.3trn is enough to buy the ten biggest listed companies in the world, including Amazon, Apple and Saudi Aramco. It is also enough to buy all the property in New York City nine times over. Over $2trn of the cost will be suffered by the euro area. America will bear roughly $1.7trn. Among developing countries, India is set to endure the biggest loss in dollar terms: about $950bn (although the bank’s forecast for India’s growth in 2021 seems unduly pessimistic). Although China’s economy is much bigger than that of India, it will suffer a smaller gdp shortfall of about $680bn. Even these colossal numbers understate the cost, however. The economic damage, after all, will not be confined to this year and last. The World Bank expects global gdp in 2022 to remain 4.4% below its pre-pandemic predictions. It fears lasting harm to investment, human capital and, therefore, the growth potential of the world economy. It also worries that the debt that governments and companies have issued to help them weather the pandemic may harm growth in the future. There is another reason why these figures understate the economic tab. If the pandemic had never happened, world gdp would not only have been higher, it would also have been different. Instead of masks, tests, vaccines, Zoom calls and parcel deliveries, the world economy would have produced other items. Because the pandemic is so damaging to health and society, it is worth diverting vast resources to fight it—these efforts are of enormous economic value. But if the virus had never spread, these same efforts would have been unnecessary, making them an expense the world could have been spared.
Back pain is a massive problem which is badly treated |  Pete moore was 43 when he woke up one autumn morning with back pain so excruciating that he struggled to dress himself. His doctor in Romford, an English town, referred him to hospital for an mri scan; this showed that some of the spongelike discs that separate the spine’s vertebrae were bulging out of the slots into which they customarily fit. Such “slipped” discs can be caused by an injury; but they are also the sort of thing which can just happen with increasing age. Mr Moore received a prescription for opioids to help him cope with the pain; but the pain persisted, and he found himself becoming loopy. Unable to work or do much else, Mr Moore, who had been a painter, sank into depression. Three years into his ordeal, he says, he was “thinking of ending it all”. Back pain does not, in and of itself, kill people. But it makes a huge number of lives a misery. In most countries for which there are reliable figures, whether rich or poor, back pain is the top cause of disability, measured by the aggregate number of years lived in poor health. That burden is decreasing (see chart) but only very slowly. The costs, however, have been rising quite quickly—and are enormous. In 2013, according to one study, $88bn was spent on medical treatments for back and neck pain in America, not far short of the $115bn spent on cancer (more recent figures have not been analysed in a comparable way). A great deal of this money seems, sadly, to do little good. Doctors used to think that back pain was almost entirely the result of mechanical damage to tissue beyond the capacity of x-rays to detect. The advent of mri scans showed this was not true. A definitive physical cause—such as a fracture, a tumour, pressure on a nerve, infection or arthritis—is found in 5-15% of people with back pain. The rest is all labelled as “non-specific”, and there is increasing evidence that it is not mechanical in origin. Back pain, like all pain, is experienced in the brain not the body; nerves coming in tell the brain that something is amiss, and the brain projects an appropriate sensation of pain. Researchers who specialise in pain increasingly believe that, in most cases, chronic pain means that the system has become damaged in some way that keeps it switched on. “It’s like a fire alarm that goes off after the fire has been extinguished,” says Lucie Knight, a psychologist at a pain clinic in St Thomas’ Hospital, in London. Back pain may also be related to other aspects of a person’s life not going well. Taking this view seriously throws into doubt a great deal of the medical treatment of back pain—much of which, in effect, seeks to silence the maddening sound of the fire alarm by putting out a fire that isn’t there. But it does not offer an obvious medical alternative. Some pain medicines, such as paracetamol, do not work at all for back pain. Opioids, for all their reputed analgesic potency, offer back-pain relief little if any better than options such as ibuprofen. Their continued use often makes pain worse rather than better, and is highly likely to cause addiction. Drugs that worked better and did less harm would be a boon. But they have proved hard to develop. The mechanisms in the nervous system and brain which generate pain are complex, and can doubtless go wrong in a variety of ways, says Steve McMahon of King’s College London. He thinks that the development of drugs for chronic pain has a poor record because the people they are tried on have a range of different problems. Evidence of ineffectiveness has not stopped doctors from writing prescriptions for the drugs they have. The prevalence of chronic back pain provided a huge expanse of fertile ground for the deceptive marketing and poor prescription behind America’s opioid epidemic (see Bartleby). In many countries doctors also frequently prescribe painkillers called gabapentinoids, despite strong evidence from trials that, as far as treating back pain goes, they offer no benefits. There are also a lot of treatments for the back itself. Spines are injected with cement-like mixtures or fitted with various types of medical hardware. Vertebrae are fused together, discs excised or tampered with in various ways. Yet—unsurprisingly, if it is largely the pain mechanism which is the problem—there is a growing body of evidence that the benefits all this offers to most patients are limited or non-existent. Even just looking at the back causes problems. Only 1-5% of people with back pain have a problem that requires urgent treatment, such as an infection or a tumour; in such cases the pain will tend to be accompanied by other symptoms too, such as weight loss, fever or incontinence. In America and western Europe guidelines say that it is only when such red flags are present that a patient presenting with back pain should promptly be given an x-ray or an mri scan. Yet general practitioners and hospitals routinely ignore this, sending 40-60% of people with back pain to be scanned—far more than they did 20 years ago. According to Jan Hartvigsen of the University of Southern Denmark there is a broad consensus that about 80% of such scans are useless. That might be fine if the scans were sometimes helpful and never harmful. But few bodies are completely normal, and learning of your particular “abnormalities” in a medical setting and while suffering is alarming even if a healthy back might look just as odd. Disc “degeneration” is seen in roughly half of young and middle-aged adults with back pain, but also in a third of those with no pain at all. Some 40% of people with back pain have disc protrusion, a form of “slipped” disc; but so do nearly 20% of people who are pain-free. Both patients and doctors, though, tend to think that if they can see something they should do something. Some sufferers catastrophise the news into the idea that they have a broken, fragile back and start avoiding normal physical activity—not least, says Ms Knight of St Thomas’, because doctors often fail to explain to them that abnormalities are, in fact, quite normal, and that degeneration can basically be wear and tear. The stiffness and weakening of the muscles this inactivity brings often makes things worse. And doctors may take abnormalities as a cue for further medical attention. Many studies have confirmed that patients who receive unwarranted imaging in the first few weeks of back pain are more likely to have surgery and unnecessary follow-up tests than similar patients spared the scans—but that they enjoy no benefits in terms of pain reduction or lessened disability. In 2011 Cigna, an American insurance company, ran a follow-up study on patients who had undergone procedures in which vertebrae are stitched together with implanted bolts and braces. “Spinal fusion” of this type is a frequently used surgical response to back pain that is associated with the degeneration of spinal discs; in 2015 there were roughly 85,000 such surgeries in America. The company found that two years after treatment 87% of customers were still in pain severe enough for medication or some other treatment; 15% had more surgery. This is going to hurt It all sounds depressing. It need not be so. There are ways of dealing with back pain that waste much less money and leave patients less distressed and with a greater sense of their own agency. Mr Moore, the patient with whom this story began, tried to come to terms with his disabling pain by starting a support group for fellow sufferers. A psychologist from St Thomas’, which has the biggest pain clinic in Europe, came to talk to them about “graded exercise” and the importance of pacing themselves when going out and about. “Nobody had told me I could do these things,” says Mr Moore. In 1996, three years after back pain had come to dominate his existence, a two-week residential programme at the pain clinic taught him what it teaches people today: exercise daily; accept flare-ups as temporary setbacks; don’t get fixated on the pain. Learning to keep going this way “saved my life”, Mr Moore says. The programme, explains Ms Knight, aims not to reduce pain so much as to add to life. People naturally struggle against the pain, which means they are burdened with the pain and the struggle too. “If you can drop the struggle,” says Ms Knight, “then you have your hands free to do more.” Patients are taught how to gradually overcome their fears of exercise and daily activities that can cause some pain. The goals that they start with can be as simple as calling a friend and meeting for a coffee, or attending a wedding. In a typical class of ten people, Ms Knight says, one or two decide that the approach is not what they want, and may drop out. Most of them take away at least some skills which add to their quality of life. One or two, like Mr Moore, find the programme life-changing. Various countries have tried to encourage people with back pain to stay active, with promising effects. One such campaign, in Australia, is reckoned to have led to a 15% reduction in the number of doctor visits for back pain and a 20% decrease in related medical costs. Such campaigns appear to work best when they provide practical advice on how to stay active and at work despite the pain, and when as well as speaking to the afflicted they enroll employers, clinicians and unions as partners. Activity is not a panacea, and if leading an active life with pain is better than withdrawing from the world, it is still not ideal. But interventions like this seem to offer people more succour than highly medicalised approaches. Unfortunately, medical schools, patient expectations and the policies of insurers and governments all sustain the latter. All around the world, family doctors are woefully undertrained to treat common, unglamorous conditions such as bad backs. In most medical curricula musculoskeletal conditions, like back pain, are a minor feature. Back pain is “not sexy” for medical students, says Chris Maher of the University of Sydney. Even if they are going to be family doctors they still want to hear about cures for cancer and impressive forms of surgery, rather than humdrum stuff like back pain or preventing falls in older people. Spinal surgeons, for their part, often take a dim view of evidence that what they do may be ineffective. Surgical training is based on an apprenticeship model. “You learn from a master, a great guru, and you do what they taught you. You don’t learn from a paper in the British Medical Journal,” says Andrew Carr, who heads the department of orthopaedic surgery at Oxford University. Surgeons generally consider an operation successful if the incision is small, things heal nicely and there are no complications, says Maurits van Tulder from Vrije University in Amsterdam. If they ever hear back from patients, that is usually from those for whom the operation worked—which leads surgeons to believe that it works most of the time. Though research on surgical outcomes is becoming a lot more widespread, it is still hard to convince surgeons that what they have been doing for most of their careers is ineffective, says Dr Carr. It is also hard to convince patients that, when it comes to treatment, less may be more. Told that the best thing they can do about back pain is exercise their body and their patience, they often think they are being fobbed off; a deluge of online marketing for ineffective treatments does not help. Some harangue their doctors for scans or injections, or find a new more biddable one. For a busy doctor, says Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Australia, “it’s easier to prescribe an x-ray than explain why you don’t need one.” Once pain becomes chronic, persuading sufferers that the cause is not a fixable physical defect becomes much harder. Graeme Wilkes, a British doctor, says that he might spend an hour telling a patient that the things seen on his mri may not be the reasons for his back pain, and that a spinal injection is unlikely to help. “The reason they’ve got back pain is that they have financial problems, marital problems, disabled children, they are not sleeping at night—not those changes in their mri scan,” says Dr Wilkes. “And they go home and someone says ‘Oh, that’s absolute rubbish that you can’t get an injection, because my mate at work had it and he was much better afterwards. Don’t listen to them, go back to your gp and get referred’.” But the biggest reason why so many people with back pain get the wrong treatments is that governments and insurance plans pay for them. In America, Australia and the Netherlands health plans pay for back operations that cost $25,000-100,000 apiece. American plans often support the alternative therapy offered by chiropractors. There is some evidence that this may do some good in back pain, but the research is patchy and any benefits small and short-lived. Yet the same plans typically offer little support for physiotherapy to the same end. If a therapy has been accepted by an insurance company, or a government scheme like America’s Medicare, it is very hard to get it removed, even if evidence for effectiveness persistently fails to turn up. “Once they are in, it is hard to take them out,” says Dan Cherkin from the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. The manufacturers of medical devices are very good at lobbying to get them covered as treatments. They are also “incredibly effective” in marketing their wares to doctors, says Richard Deyo of Oregon Health and Science University. Back pain is big business for many surgeons, doctors and chiropractors. “If we stop doing low-value care, some entire professions have to change fundamentally what they do,” says Lorimer Moseley of the University of South Australia after enumerating a long list of ineffective treatments. In some systems cupidity encourages such things. In America, where procedures are more lucrative than talking to patients, an unscrupulous doctor might prefer to spend a 15-minute appointment giving a patient an injection rather than some education, just as a harried one might. Other countries have had some success with an approach called “Choosing Wisely”, in which doctors explain to patients the evidence on the effectiveness of various treatment options and decide together what is best given each patient’s personal goals (which could range from simply wanting to be able to play with their grandchildren to cycling or running). In Britain there has been a determined move towards triage which assigns back-pain patients to more or less intensive treatment depending on the complexity of their problems. In Australia some emergency rooms have started sending some back-pain patients brought in by ambulance straight to physiotherapists, which avoids a significant amount of hospitalisation. Choosing poorly But when professional associations in America urged doctors to take up the Choosing Wisely model their campaign made almost no difference to back-pain treatment—perhaps because doctors were under no obligation to change, says Dr Deyo. Nor has a change in the advice provided by the American College of Physicians had any great effect as yet. In 2017 the college stopped recommending medication as an initial response to back pain, suggesting instead acupuncture, yoga, tai-chi and psychological therapies aimed at reducing stress, all of which have been shown to reduce pain-related disability. Insurers have taken note, with some now covering some or more of these alternatives. That will make it easier for doctors moved to change their practice to do so. Another approach might be to nudge doctors incrementally, rather than to change their practices once and for all. Tweaking the interface of the electronic systems doctors use to order mris so that it takes them longer to place an order has been shown to reduce the number of unnecessary scans. Adding a pop-up reminder explaining why imaging is frequently unnecessary has also shown effects. Disability-benefit systems matter a lot, too. In many countries benefit systems give people signed off with back pain few incentives to improve, and their erstwhile employers no incentive to encourage them back rather than find someone else. In the Netherlands, though, this has changed. Medical assessment for disability benefits does not kick in for two years after a patient reports sick, and during this time employers must pay the sick employee 70-100% of their wages. Employers and employees are also required by law to agree a return-to-work plan. After the country switched to this system, in 2006, the total number of sick days for back pain fell by a third. The return-to-work rate after a three-to-four-month sick leave due to back pain is now 62% in the Netherlands. In neighbouring Germany it is only 22%. Drivers for such change are hard to come by in part because, as Dr Maher says, back pain is largely invisible. People do not die from it and there are no “back-pain survivors” to spearhead lapel-ribbon campaigns for change. Few national medical plans even mention back pain. Sufferers are often viewed as impostors, or told that it is all in their heads. Though other aspects of a patient’s life do impede recovery from back pain, many people cannot easily take control over the context of their life, still less the content of their heads. The lack of a lobby accounts in part for the absence of more impressive projects to move beyond medical devices and drugs. In 2018 Dr Buchbinder was one of the authors of a series of studies on back pain published in the Lancet which they pitched to the journal in the hope that summarising the debacle in rich countries would warn developing countries not to follow suit. But when the researchers began to compile the data, she says, they discovered that in poor countries the horse had already bolted. In India, Brazil, China, Nepal, Iran and other developing countries doctors are already prescribing drugs, injections and x-rays for simple back pain. In some urban areas of India and Africa opioids can be easily bought from the roadside chemists where many poor people go first for aches and pains. Mr Moore, for his part, has not taken pain medication since 1997. To keep his pain at a manageable level, he starts his day with stretching at home for half an hour, followed by an hour and a half at the gym. And he leads a full life.
The promise and peril of gene drives | “I think i got it,” says Alekos Simoni with a grin, returning an electronic fly zapper called “The Executioner” to a nearby metal shelf. With a deft flick of his wrist he has done away with a genetically modified mosquito that was making a bid for freedom. There are many levels of containment to ensure such creatures do not leave this basement laboratory at Imperial College, London. But none, perhaps, quite so satisfying as The Executioner. The extermination that the creatures in Mr Simoni’s lab are designed to take part in is less viscerally gratifying—but far more consequential. The mosquitoes are being fitted with a piece of dna called a gene drive. Unlike the genes introduced into run-of-the-mill genetically modified organisms, gene drives do not just sit still once inserted into a chromosome. They actively spread themselves, thereby reaching more and more of the population with each generation. If their effect is damaging, they could in principle wipe out whole species. To engineer an extinction is quite a step. But it is not unprecedented. In 1980 Variola, the smallpox virus, was exterminated from the wild. That marked the eradication of a disease which, from 1900 to 1980, killed around 300m people. If gene drives like those being worked on at Imperial and elsewhere were to condemn to a similar fate the mosquitoes that spread malaria, a second of humankind’s great scourges might be consigned to history. It need not stop with malaria. Gene drives can in principle be used against any creatures which reproduce sexually with short generations and aren’t too rooted to a single spot. The insects that spread leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, dengue fever, chikungunya, trypanosomiasis and Zika could all be potential targets. So could creatures which harm only humankind’s dominion, not people themselves. Biologists at the University of California, San Diego, have developed a gene-drive system for Drosophila suzukii, an Asian fruitfly which, as an invasive species, damages berry and fruit crops in America and Europe. Island Conservation, an international environmental ngo, thinks gene drives could offer a humane and effective way of reversing the damage done by invasive species such as rats and stoats to native ecosystems in New Zealand and Hawaii. Needless to say, the enthusiasm is not universal. Other environmental groups worry that it will not prove possible to contain gene drives to a single place, and that species seen as invasive in one place might end up decimated in other places where they are blameless, or even beneficial. If drives are engineered into species that play a pivotal but previously unappreciated ecological role, or if they spread from a species of little ecological consequence to a close relative that matters more, they could have damaging and perhaps irreversible effects on ecosystems. Such critics fear that the laudable aim of vastly reducing deaths from malaria—which the World Health Organisation puts at 445,000 a year, most of them children—will open the door to the use of gene drives for far less clear-cut benefits in ways that will entrench some interests, such as those of industrial farmers, at the expense of others. They also point to possible military applications: gene drives could in principle make creatures that used not to spread disease more dangerous. Thinking nothing’s wrong Although allegations of playing God are two a penny in debates about breakthrough technologies, with gene drives they do feel better-founded than usual. The ability to remove species by fiat—in effect, to get them to remove themselves—is, like the prospect of making new species from scratch, a power that goes beyond the past ambit of humankind. Gene drives are, at heart, a particularly selfish sort of gene. Most animals have two copies of most of their genes, one on the set of chromosomes they got from their mother, one on those from their father. But they put only one version of each gene—either the maternal one or the paternal one, at random—into each of their own gametes (sperm or eggs). Some genes, though, seek to subvert this randomising in order to get into more than 50% of the gametes, and thus more than 50% of the next generation. In 1960 George Craig, an American entomologist, suggested that such subversive genes might be a way of controlling the populations of disease-carrying mosquitoes, for example by making them more likely to have male offspring than female ones. In 2003 Austin Burt, at Imperial College, described how a gene drive that could cut a place for itself in a chromosome and copy itself into the resulting gap could, in the right circumstances, drive a species to extinction. A fascinating idea, but one hard to put into practice—until, in 2012, a powerful new gene-editing tool called crispr-Cas9 became available. Gene drives based on crispr-Cas9 could easily be engineered to target specific bits of the chromosome and insert themselves seamlessly into the gap, thus ensuring that every gamete gets a copy (see diagram). By 2016, gene drives had been created in yeast, fruitflies and two species of mosquito. In work published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in September, Andrea Crisanti, Mr Burt and colleagues at Imperial showed that one of their gene drives could drive a small, caged population of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae to extinction—the first time a gene drive had shown itself capable of doing this. The next step is to try this in a larger caged population. This drive disrupts a gene called doublesex that controls the differentiation of the sexes. Mosquitoes with one copy of the drive pass it on to all of their offspring. Females with two copies—which crop up more and more often as the gene spreads through the population—are sterile. Using sterile insects to control disease is not, in itself, a novel technique. Swamping a population of disease-spreading insects with individuals that cannot reproduce can be an effective way to limit numbers; lots of the fertile wild ones breed fruitlessly with the sterile interlopers. What is new here is that a gene drive can actively spread sterility through a population. Evolution can be expected to take a dim view of such an affront. Mutants which lack the dna sequence that the drive targets, and which can thus escape its distorting effects, will be hugely favoured in the population that the drive is attacking. The cleverness of the Imperial scheme lies in choosing doublesex as its target. Without a functional copy of doublesex, mosquitoes cannot reproduce. Mutations which stop the gene drive from targeting it are also likely to stop the gene working properly—it is unusually sensitive to change. So a mosquito in which doublesex is sufficiently messed up by random mutation that the gene drive no longer has a target will be unable to reproduce anyway. The scientists at Imperial are part of Target Malaria, a research alliance supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Philanthropy Project Fund to the tune of around $5m a year since it started in 2005. Target Malaria is already working in Burkina Faso, Mali and Uganda to prepare the way for a release of a gene drive. It would be introduced on top of a regime that includes bed nets, insecticide sprays and drugs for those infected (which kill the malaria parasites in the blood and thus stop them from hitching a lift in the next mosquito to stop by for a drink). With that amount of back-up, even a gene drive to which resistance evolves could break the cycle of malaria transmission definitively, wiping it out in the trial area. If that worked, the rest of Africa—home to 90% of the world’s malaria cases—could soon follow suit. Pay attention to your dreams The Imperial team thinks that, scientifically, they might have drives able to make a difference in about three years. But the Gates Foundation is talking about 2026 as a possible date for trials that involve a release in the wild. Margret Engelhard, a biosafety expert at the German federal agency for nature conservation, points out some of the challenges ahead. These include evaluating the gene drives before release, predicting how the modified mosquitoes will behave in the wild and working out whether there will be knock-on effects on other species. Tilly Collins at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial says that published ecological studies of A. gambiae—one of three mosquito species that carry malaria, and by far the most important vector for the disease in Africa—have turned up nothing that preys on them to the exclusion of other foods. There is a vampire spider that lives around the shores of Lake Victoria that has a fondness for the females when full of human blood, but it will readily eat other mosquito species. Work is under way to validate these findings in the field, and to discover whether the mosquito’s larvae are similarly dispensable. At present, it looks unlikely that removing one or two of over 3,000 mosquito species will have any significant effect on the ecosystems in which they live. What, though, of the risk that a drive might spread beyond its target species? In theory, because gene drives require their bearers to have offspring if they are to spread, they should stay in a single species; distinct species cannot, in general, reproduce through sex. However in the case of doublesex the target gene sequence is found across all 16 species of Anopheles analysed so far—this is the flipside of it being so resistant to mutation. And there is a small but measurable rate of hybridisation between some of those species. That probably would not allow a lot of spread: but the possibility needs examining. The New Partnership for Africa’s Development, an organ of the African Union, has recommended that the Union’s member states support studies to verify the technology in African settings—including conducting a thorough investigation of the risks and looking for measures that may mitigate any negative impacts. Target Malaria is trying to get locals used to the idea of working with, and releasing, mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered by scientists. The next step will be the release, in Burkina Faso, of male mosquitoes genetically engineered to be sterile. That will help the scientists understand population dynamics, but with no gene drive to push the sterility into the population it will have no effect on malaria per se. The Target Malaria gene-drive project carries the prospect of huge humanitarian gains. It is carefully designed, supported by deep-pocketed philanthropists and being carried out under a fair level of international scrutiny. It is gaining political support and inspiring a generation of researchers. It is hard to see it grinding to a halt in the absence of massive opposition, a currently unheralded alternative or profound technical failure. As Jim Thomas of the etc Group, an ngo that opposes gene drives, says, malaria is the “best possible use-case scenario” for the technology. The worry of the etc Group and its fellow travellers is that the use of gene drives against malaria will open the door to more troubling, slipshod and exploitative applications. Many may sound good: some of the $70m that Tata Trusts of Mumbai, a philanthropy group, has given to the University of California, San Diego,is for exploring ways of using gene drives to make crops more resistant to drought. If the technology were predictable, controllable and well-regulated, the potential for raised crop yields in the face of climate change, and perhaps reduced use of pesticides and herbicides, might be huge. But experience shows that few technologies make it into the world in a predictable, controllable and well-regulated form. Mr Thomas sees a raising of the stakes from a world in which businesses modify seeds crop by crop to one where they modify whole populations, indeed all of nature. “It is a pretty audacious switch,” he says. In a report published in 2016, America’s National Academies of Science highlighted the possibility of drives introduced for agricultural reasons damaging people’s welfare. Excoriated as “pigweed” in the United States, related species of the plant are cultivated for food in Mexico, South America, India and China. American farmers might like a gene drive to eradicate pigweed, which has become resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, which is widely used in conjunction with today’s genetically modified crops. But they would not necessarily bear the risks, or liability, of a release that went on to do damage to food crops in other countries. There are also worries about how gene drives might be used to create a weapon. Humans are an unlikely target; a weapon that acts over generations seems ill-suited to war or terror, and the idea that future generations will not have their genomes sequenced in a way that shows up such attacks feels far-fetched. But they might conceivably be used to make small and rapidly reproducing insect and rodent species more objectionable or pathogenic. The need to find ways to guard against such attacks is one of the reasons that the Pentagon’s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa) gives for its work on gene drives. Renee Wegrzyn, programme manager for darpa’s “Safe Genes” project, says the work is to prevent “technological surprise”, whether in the form of an unintended consequence or nefarious use. One of the academic teams she funds has made progress in developing anti-crispr enzyme systems that one day might be able to inhibit a drive’s operation. Many groups are working on ways of making gene drives more controllable and less risky. One option is to create “immunising” drives that could spread resistance to a drive gone rogue. Another is to limit the drive’s power to spread. Current gene drives are self-driving: the cutting mechanism and the thing that gets spread are one and the same. But that is not the way things have to be. In the “daisy chain” drive designed by Kevin Esvelt of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gene drives are linked up in sequence, with the first creating the space for the second to copy itself into, the second creating the space for the third, and so on, until you finally get to the gene that you want to drive through the population. Because the upstream drives do not copy and spread themselves, they drop away, generation by generation, until only the last gene remains. Think of it like the stages of a rocket launching a satellite—or warhead. Each stage gets the gene of interest further into the population before falling away. But once the last stage has burned out, the payload just goes where gravity takes it, powerless to push itself further. Such a self-limiting system might have a big effect over the short term, but vanish in the long term. These developments make it easier to imagine gene drives being used with minimal risk. But it is still the case that without care some gene drives might have the potential to trigger irreversible ecological shifts before countermeasures could be deployed. That is clear from decades of work on invasive species that are released either deliberately or accidentally. And because the effects of each drive will be unique, depending on the design of the drive, the gene or genes that it targets, the population it is introduced into and the ecosystem in which that population sits, the technology calls for a sort of joined-up regulation that does not yet exist. In 2014 Kenneth Oye of mit and his colleagues pointed out in the journal Science the many gaps in America’s patchwork of regulatory frameworks relevant to gene drives. Oversight needs not just to bring together a range of government agencies; it requires co-operation between governments, too. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which entered into force under the un Convention on Biological Diversity (cbd) in 2003, provides controls on the transfer of genetically modified organisms. But how it applies to gene drives is unclear—and besides, America has never ratified the convention. An attempt to ban gene-drive research through the cbd, which was backed by the etc Group and other ngos, failed at the convention’s biennial meeting in Cancún in 2016. A less ambitious call for restraint in field tests is likely to suffer the same fate later this month in Egypt. At present there is no consensus on what level and distribution of risk humankind is willing to accept from such technologies, nor what loss of wildness it is willing to accept. Like the reintroduction of vanished species advocated by the rewilding movement, gene-drive technology will provide new arenas for the fight between those who wish to defend nature and those who wish to tame it. There is still time for such debate. The Gates Foundation does not expect to be ready for field trials for at least eight years. And the debate may be more fruitful if research continues to open up new options for better-designed interventions. If gene-drive research had been banned under the cbd two years ago, various self-limiting exotica currently under development might not have been dreamt up. For malaria, at least so far, the case for moving towards tests in the field is a strong one. That does not mean that other uses will be as compelling down the line, or that there is no need for vigilance. And none of this will, in practice, be as neat as a swipe with an electronic tennis racquet. But for millions of Africans living with the burden of malaria, the idea of never needing to fear the bite of another mosquito could change the world.
Why people in rich countries are eating more vegan food | IT IS lunchtime and a queue is forming for the burgers at Krowarzywa, voted the city’s best in an online poll: students, families, businessmen in suits. This is Warsaw, where (you might think) lunch is usually a slab of meat with a side order of sausage. But at Krowarzywa—which means “cow alive” and contains the word warzywa, meaning vegetables—no animals were harmed in the making of the food. The burgers are made of millet, tofu or chickpeas. The bestselling “vegan pastrami” is made of seitan, a wheat-based meat substitute. Warsaw has almost 50 vegan restaurants. That does not mean it has all that many vegans. Kassia, a 20-something professional in the queue, says she has no ethical objection to eating meat. She comes to Krowarzywa because she likes the food. Kornel Kisala, the head chef, thinks that most of Krowarzywa’s clientele eat meat, but it does not worry him. “Animals don’t care whether you eat a vegan burger because it is fashionable or because it is tasty.” Altogether, 60% of Poles say they plan to cut back on meat this year. Eating vegetarian and vegan meals now and then is one of the ways some choose to do so. Interest in vegan food has been booming across the rich world. Celebrity claims of veganism are everywhere: Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Serena and Venus Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Mike Tyson, Beyoncé, take your pick. In America sales of “plant-based” foods—a term for foods that contain no meat, eggs or dairy that reliably says “vegan” to vegans but doesn’t say “weird” to the less committed—rose 20% in the year to June 2018, according to Nielsen, a market-research group. That was ten times the growth in food as a whole that year and two and a half times faster than vegan foods grew in the year before. McDonald’s is offering McVegan burgers in Scandinavia. The American restaurants in the TGI Fridays chain sell soyabean burgers that ooze blood made of beetroot juice. Tyson Foods, one of the world’s largest meat producers, recently bought 5% of Beyond Meat, the company which makes them. Waitrose, a posh British grocery chain, introduced a range of vegan food in 2017, expanded the selection by 60% in mid-2018 and says sales of vegan and vegetarian foods in July 2018 were 70% above the level in July 2017. Some people see great things in this. Two years ago Eric Schmidt, a Silicon Valley figure who used to be chairman of Google, called plant-based meat substitutes the world’s most important future technology; he foresaw them improving people’s health, reducing environmental degradation and making food more affordable for the poor in developing countries. The founder of the first vegan society said in 1944 that “in time [people] will view with abhorrence the idea that men once fed on the products of animals’ bodies.” Many since have shared his hope. Perhaps their time is come at last. If so, it is a slow coming. Meat consumption worldwide has been growing consistently by almost 3% a year since 1960, mostly because people in poor countries buy more meat as they get richer, and the trend has yet to slow. In the early 1970s the average Chinese person ate 14kg (31lb) of meat a year. Now they eat 55kg, which is 150g, or five ounces, a day. But though most growth in consumption has been in the developing world, rich countries are eating more meat, too; their consumption is just not growing as fast as it used to. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), meat consumption in the richest nations has risen 0.7% a year since 1991. Polling data is used to claim that the number of vegans in rich countries is both quite high—around 10% in some European countries—and growing. But there is reason to doubt at least the first of these. Some of the best data come from Britain, home of the world’s first vegan society. A poll carried out by that society in 2016 found that 1.05% of people in Britain never ate meat or animal products. This is considerably higher than the result the society got in 2007, which suggests real growth in numbers. But it is a far cry from the 5.3% of the population reported as vegan in a more recent poll. In general, polls seem to find many more people claiming to be vegan than they do people abstaining from all meat, fish and animal products. In America, Nielsen found in 2017 that 3% of the population called themselves vegans and 6% vegetarians (people who eschew meat, but eat eggs and/or dairy products). This proportion seems more or less stable; the country’s largest polling organisations, Gallup and Harris, both found 3% of the population calling themselves vegan over the period 2012-18. But more detailed research by Faunalytics, a company which has been running large surveys of eating habits for 20 years, puts the numbers at just 0.5% for vegans and 3.4% for vegetarians. Fully a quarter of 25- to 34-year-olds in America claim to be either vegan or vegetarian, whereas studies by Faunalytics find the median age of American vegans to be 42, four years older than the national median. It seems that a fair amount of aspirational self-deception, terminological inexactitude or simple hypocrisy is at play. The idea that veganism is most widely espoused, if not necessarily adhered to, by the young seems to be true in many countries. In Germany, according to Mintel, a research firm, 15% of 16- to 24-year-olds say that they are vegetarian, compared with 7% of the population at large. In many countries declared vegans lean towards the political left. In America polling by Pew has found that 15% of liberals espouse a meat-free diet, as opposed to 4% of Republicans. American vegans and vegetarians are also poorer than average, and twice as likely to be single. Three-quarters of them are women. This all fits veganism’s association with valuing health, simplicity and low environmental impact—an implicit rejection of the values and coronary arteries of older red-meat-eating men. Veganism is not a way of life that it is easy to keep up. According to Faunalytics, for every active American vegetarian or vegan there are more than five people who say they have abandoned such a diet. The growth in the number of restaurants catering to veganism and the availability of plant-based products on shelves may reduce this churn and allow more to stick with the programme. As it is, a moving target makes it unsurprising that accurate figures on veganism are hard to come by. Overall, though, it seems safe to say that the number of people sometimes or regularly choosing to eat vegan food is growing much faster than the growth in people deeply committed to a meat-, egg- and dairy-free life. Patrice Bula, a vice-president at Nestlé, says he thinks that only a quarter of the people buying his company’s vegan meals are committed vegetarians or vegans. People in this larger group are often called “flexitarians”, who shift back and forth between omnivorous and vegetable diets. Almost two Americans in five say they fit this category, says Nielsen. The true vegan efflorescence lies in casual, part-time veganism. Flexible friends of the Earth In rich countries, people become flexitarians as a response to three concerns: their own health; the health of the environment; and the welfare of animals. On all three, they have a point; on at least the first two, though, a lot of the benefits can be captured without strict veganism. The direct evidence that vegan and vegetarian diets are in themselves good for people is mixed. Between 2002 and 2007, 73,000 Seventh Day Adventists, a religious group in America, participated in a study of eating habits. The 27,000 vegans and vegetarians among them had significantly lower mortality rates. A smaller survey of British vegetarians from 2016, though, found no such link. Aspects of veganism do go with the grain of some health advice. Large studies have shown that people who eat a lot of red meat have higher overall mortality rates (the same does not apply to eating poultry). Eating a lot of processed meat is linked to colorectal cancer. The evidence on this seems clear enough for various authorities to recommend limits to the total ingestion of red meat—the World Cancer Research Fund suggests less than 500g a week—and minimising the intake of processed meats such as bacon and salami. And the damage to health done by meat is not all captured in the sort of studies that reliably cast doubt on diets heavy in red meat. Lots of factors, both dietary and non-dietary, influence health problems such as obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes, and it is hard to understand exactly what is responsible for what. Comparing diets on a statistical basis, though, allows some striking inferences. In 2016 a study by Marco Springmann and colleagues at the University of Oxford found that, globally, a transition to well-balanced vegan diets might result in 8.1m fewer deaths a year. Universal vegetarianism would avoid 7.3m deaths. If the associations on which this computer modelling is based are robust, those are impressive figures. But much of the benefit they claim to demonstrate could still be realised if omnivores ate better-balanced diets with less meat. If the world adopted what the study called a healthy global diet, with less sugar than most in the West consume, plenty of fruit and veg and just 43g of red meat a day, the number of deaths avoided would still be 5.1m. Red meat is typically a quarter to a third protein by weight, so just 43g is nowhere near enough to supply the 50-60g of protein a day that people require (the exact amount depends on a person’s weight, amount of exercise and several other factors). The global healthy diet thus has people relying on quite a lot of plant protein, too. Rich-world diets, though, tend to get all their daily protein requirement from animals, and then some. Americans eat 90g of protein a day, Europeans 85g, and most of it comes from animal products. Because meat is energy rich, eating more than your protein needs dictate means taking on a lot of calories, which may well be stored as fat. Vegans both eat less protein and get it from less energy-rich and potentially fattening products. In 2017 a French study found that both vegans (62g of protein a day) and vegetarians (67g) were healthier than the meat eaters wolfing down 81g. They were also eating more varied diets, and, perhaps crucially, fewer calories overall; it may have been those choices, rather than veganism per se, that made the difference. On the environment, too, vegans and vegetarians have a point. Growing their food requires less land than raising meat does. Animals do not turn all the energy in the crops they eat into calories in their muscles. They need some of that energy to stay alive—and while that overhead is good for the animals, from a food-production standpoint it looks like a waste. This waste means you need more land per calorie of food if you are producing beef than if you are producing broccoli. Admittedly, a lot of grazing is on land that would not necessarily be suitable for arable farming. But the FAO’s finding that raising livestock takes about 80% of all agricultural land and produces just 18% of the world’s calories is still telling. Alon Shepon of the Weizmann Institute and colleagues have looked at this in terms of opportunity costs. Choosing to make a gram of protein by feeding an egg-laying hen, rather than getting the equivalent of a gram of egg protein from plants, has an opportunity cost of 40%. Getting the gram of protein from beef represents an opportunity cost of 96% (see chart 1). They argue that if America stopped paying these opportunity costs and got the protein from plants in the first place, it would be equivalent to increasing the food supply by a third—or eliminating all of the losses due to food waste. Being so land hungry means cattle farming changes the climate; clearing land for pasture creates greenhouse gases. On top of that, the bugs in ruminant digestive systems produce methane, a fairly powerful greenhouse gas. Once it gets out of the cows—by belching, mainly, not, as is commonly thought, farting—this warms the world. The FAO calculates that cattle generate up to two-thirds of the greenhouse gases from livestock, and are the world’s fifth largest source of methane. If cows were a country, the United Herds of Earth would be the planet’s third largest greenhouse-gas emitter. Mr Springmann and his colleagues calculated that in 2050 greenhouse emissions from agriculture in a vegan world would be 70% lower than in a world where people ate as they do today; in the “healthy global diet” world they would be 29% lower. The savings are not all owing to cows; but a large part of them are (see chart 2). Raising cattle produces seven times more in terms of emissions per tonne of protein than raising pork or poultry does, 12 times more than soya and 30 times more than wheat. Giving up beef captures many of the benefits of going vegan. Other animals make a lot less difference. Getting your protein from insects—very efficient converters—might be almost indistinguishable from veganism in environmental terms. Except, that is, to the insects. One of the main things that motivates many vegans and vegetarians is a belief that killing and eating animals is wrong. The vegans also abstain from milk and eggs because there, too, they see a lot of exploitation, death and suffering (the question of honey remains a point of contention). In dairy herds calves are typically taken from their mothers within 24 hours, compared with the nine months to a year they would suckle if left to themselves. Male calves are killed or reared for meat. In industrial egg-production day-old male chicks are killed and simply discarded. Even if one keeps strictly to meat, though, the death toll involved is immense. Over 50bn farm animals are killed for meat every year. The best known proponent of the case that this matters is Peter Singer, a philosopher at Princeton University. Mr Singer argues that treating the interests of humans as superior to those of other animals is a prejudice, analogous to treating men as superior to women or whites as superior to blacks. It depends on an arbitrary distinction between two groups, one of which has the power to make the distinction stick. What matters, he says, is not what species an individual belongs to but its capacity for suffering. If an animal suffers as much as a person, then things that it would be impermissible to do to a person—killing and eating him, immobilising him in a cage—are unacceptable if done to the animal, too. “In suffering,” Mr Singer writes, “the animals are our equals.” This moral point would seem to depend in part on an empirical point; to what extent and in what manner do animals suffer? Animals’ brains contain regions clearly analogous to those correlated with consciousness, perception and emotion in humans. What that reveals about their suffering as compared with a human’s is a subtle question. But they definitely feel pain, and some can both express preferences and, it would appear, hold beliefs about the preferences of others. That would seem to have some moral salience. But would it be better for animals that suffer not to exist at all? A vegan world would have no need of cows, happy or sad. The genus Bos currently numbers some 1.5bn. Should those lives be valued less than the lives of the wildlife which might repopulate their overgrown pastures when they are gone? When it comes to wild animals, people tend to abhor population collapse; are things that different when it comes to domestic animals? Mr Singer’s project of seeking legal rights for animals is certainly going to be a tough row to hoe, if not an impossible one. Neither courts nor legislatures seem very interested. Reducing the cruelty that animals suffer, though, is more plausible, both through legislation—battery cages for hens have been banned in the EU since 2013—and through consumer pressure, such as a preference for free-range products, cruelty-free certification, transparent sourcing and the like. This second route, though, is not available to vegans. Though biology is not destiny, humans, like their relatives the chimpanzees, evolved as omnivores; the evidence is in the teeth and the guts. If people’s diet is otherwise restricted, for example to staple starches, meat does them good. As the increasing consumption of meat worldwide shows, a lot of people in most cultures really do like eating it; the vast majority will do so, at least a bit, when they get the chance. The great exception is India, where, mostly for religious reasons, about 30% of the population has a vegetarian lifestyle. None of that makes veganism, full- or part-time, and the spread of plant-based foods irrelevant. A mixture of ethical concerns, innovative cuisine like Mr Kisala’s and more convenient vegan shopping at supermarkets could yet see the rich world reach “peak meat” and head down the other side. If so, and in particular if reduced consumption of red meat is part of the process, there will probably be substantial gains in health and happiness. And if the world improves standards in the meat-rearing operations that remain, some of that may even be shared with animals.
How to simplify the treatment of snake bites | Snake venom kills around 140,000 people a year and debilitates roughly 400,000 others. One reason for these large numbers is that every venom needs a specific antivenin to treat it. In places with rich ophidian faunas, dozens of antivenins may therefore need to be kept to hand. Even if these are available, though, they are no guarantee of success. Someone who has been bitten may not have seen the assailant, or may be an unreliable witness. Only if the snake itself has been caught or killed can medics be sure what they are dealing with. To make things worse still, administering the wrong antivenin may not merely be useless, but dangerous, for incorrect treatment sometimes provokes a further adverse reaction. In addition, antivenins themselves, which are made by injecting snake venom into large, robust animals such as horses and then collecting serum containing the antibodies generated, have to be kept refrigerated. Unfortunately, many of the tropical areas in which venomous snakes are abundant and diverse are also those where continuous supplies of electricity for refrigeration cannot be taken for granted. And, to cap things off, antivenins must be injected rather than being taken orally, so the person doing the injecting requires at least a modicum of training. This, then, is a field that seems ripe for disruption. An ideal antivenin should be universal, thermally stable and orally administered. All three of these desiderata suggest abandoning the antibody approach and trying instead to find small-molecule drugs that will do the job. And disruption may be at hand in the person of Nicholas Casewell of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, in Britain. As he reports in Nature Communications, Dr Casewell thinks he has found an antidote that is indeed stable and orally administered. It is not, admittedly, universal. But it does seem to work against the toxins of an entire family of snakes—the Viperidae, or vipers—that are responsible for more than half of snakebite deaths. Though viper venoms, like those of other snakes, vary between species, they have a common theme. Roughly half the toxins in them belong to one of two groups of enzymes—the Zn2+ metalloproteinases or the phospholipase a2s. It is these enzymes in particular that seem responsible for the extensive tissue damage and haemorrhaging which make viper bites so deadly. Drugs that mop up or neutralise Zn2+ metalloproteinases and phospholipase a2s might thus act as effective antivenins for viper bites. So Dr Casewell and his colleagues decided to look for some. A search of the literature yielded three promising candidates. One, varespladib, is an inhibitor of phospholipase a2s used to treat a range of inflammatory diseases. The second, marimastat, was once tested as an anticancer agent. It proved ineffective for that purpose, but did inhibit circulation of Zn2+ metalloproteinases. The third, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (dmps), is employed to treat heavy-metal poisoning and is good at eliminating Zn2+ metalloproteinases. To test their findings, Dr Casewell and his team injected a group of mice with venoms from a range of Viperidae that often kill people. These included saw-scaled vipers from west Africa and South Asia; Russell’s viper, also from South Asia; the African puff adder; and the fer-de-lance from Central America. They left some mice to their fate, as controls. The others received one or more of the putative antivenins. The control mice all died within an hour. Those receiving a single drug did little better. Most keeled over within six hours. Combinations containing dmps were patchily effective, protecting against some venoms but not others. But mice dosed with a combination of varespladib and marimastat lived on indefinitely. That is encouraging. And both varespladib and marimastat are thermally stable and have passed human safety trials as lone prescriptions, so testing them in combination on people should be easier than if they were fresh out of a laboratory. There is still, however, a fair amount of lab work to be done before any such trial might be contemplated. In particular, the experiments so far have injected the drugs rather than administering them orally. Though they are given by mouth when offered to people for other purposes, their efficacy against snake venom when delivered this way would need to be established. But if the therapy Dr Casewell and his colleagues hope they have discovered does prove effective in people, then it will greatly simplify the treatment of snake bites. In the meantime, they are looking to simplify things still further by doing for another snake family, the Elapidae, what they have done for the Viperidae, and ransacking the pharmacopoeias for promising broad-spectrum treatments. The Elapidae include such charmers as the king cobra and the black mamba. More power, then, to the researchers’ elbows.
Using urine to heat homes |  Urine, though disdained by modern society, was once surprisingly useful stuff. Street-facing laundries in ancient Rome had pissoirs attached to them, to encourage passers-by in need of relief to provide, free of charge, a raw material which was then fermented into a degreasing agent. Urine also found employment as a mordant, to assist in the dying of cloth—Scottish tweed was once notorious for smelling of the stuff when it got wet. And urine was, too, a source of potassium nitrate, one of the ingredients of gunpowder. Now, Chen Wei-Shan of Wageningen University, in the Netherlands, thinks he has found yet another use for urine—and one relevant to today’s needs rather than yesterday’s. He plans to employ it to create heat without fire from waste wood. Burning wood is a good source of heat and it can be seen as sound from the point of view of greenhouse gases. That is because the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere came thence in the first place, and would return there anyway if the wood in question were simply allowed to rot. But wood fires also bring environmental disbenefits, for they give off sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and other noxious gases along with that CO2. Researchers have therefore been looking for ways to release wood’s latent heat by composting rather than combustion. Unfortunately, unlike other stuff that is routinely composted (dung and waste food, for example) wood does not, by itself, contain a wide enough range of nutrients to sustain the relevant micro-organisms. To digest it, these bugs need dietary supplements. And those—things like ammonium chloride—are too expensive for everyday use. But urine is cheap—or would be, if routine ways of collecting it existed. And it contains large quantities of nitrogen and potassium (as its use in gunpowder demonstrates) and also of phosphorus (an element that was, as it happens, discovered by an alchemist trying to extract gold from urine). These are all nutrients which composting bugs need to thrive. So, as he writes in acs Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, Dr Chen decided to give it a go. To this end, he and his colleagues added urine to kiln-dried ash wood and composted the result in glass bottles. Some of this urine was actually a synthetic version, so that its composition was known precisely. The rest was donated by a 28-year-old man who had been medication-free during the previous two years. Both the artificial and the natural urine were diluted, to various degrees, during the process of testing. The team found that oxygen consumption, wood consumption and heat production all rose rapidly in the jars during the experiment’s first week. Once things had settled, though, it was clear natural urine had something going for it which synthetic urine did not. The best synthetic-urine dilution (one part in five parts of water) resulted in a 13% loss of mass of wood after 40 days. The best natural urine dilution (one part in 8.5) brought about a 20% loss. Why natural urine is more effective than the artificial stuff at the task Dr Chen set it remains unclear. He speculates that it is because natural urine is slightly more acidic, and that this matters to some of the relevant bugs. Which ones in particular, however, he has yet to work out. Previous experiments suggest that compost-heaps of wood fed suitable nutrients can sustain internal temperatures of 40-55°C for long periods. That is high enough to be useful for heating buildings and, with a bit of a boost, perhaps for providing hot water as well. To commercialise the idea would mean designing a suitable reactor and heat exchanger, but the waste-wood fuel would be cheap. How you would go about gathering the necessary urine in bulk, given the expense of installing a network of suitably dedicated collection points, is not clear. But governments contemplating doing so might be heartened by the fact that, in Rome, the Emperor Vespasian slapped a lucrative tax on the city’s urinals—something once commemorated in France by the slang name for an old-fashioned pissoir: “une vespasienne”.
Can you generate a magnetic field remotely? | Two centuries ago Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish physicist, demonstrated that the motion of an electric charge produces magnetism. This was the first observation of a wide-ranging phenomenon. The charged clouds of particles which float through the cosmos generate vast interstellar magnetic fields as they go. The sloshing of molten metal in Earth’s core produces the planet’s north and south magnetic poles. Even the firing of nerve cells in a human brain creates a minuscule amount of magnetism. The ubiquity of such electrically generated magnetic fields does, though, bring problems ranging from the pragmatic to the esoteric. Doctors looking at mri scans, for example, have to compensate for background magnetism. Meanwhile, experimentalists conducting precision tests may have to build complex shields to obscure the magnetic effect of something as simple as an electric wire running through the wall of their laboratory. It would be useful, then, to be able to control, limit or shape magnetic fields from a distance. Useful, but apparently impossible. For, in 1842, Samuel Earnshaw, a British physicist, demonstrated mathematically that the maximum strength of a magnetic field cannot lie outside its source. Every such field must, in other words, surround and radiate from the object which generates it. And there matters stood until Rosa Mach-Batlle of the Autonomous University of Barcelona spotted a way around Earnshaw’s conclusions. She has not actually proved him wrong. But she has shown that multiple magnetic fields, each obeying Earnshaw’s theorem individually, can collectively appear to bypass it. As they describe in Physical Review Letters, Dr Mach-Batlle and her colleagues pulled off their trick in a surprisingly simple way, by arranging 20 straight wires next to one another in the form of a cylinder 40cm tall and 8cm in diameter, with a 21st running through the cylinder’s centre. When they passed electric currents through all 21 wires a complex pattern of magnetic field lines blossomed in the surrounding area, forming shapes which varied with the strength and direction of the individual currents. By choosing the right combination of currents the researchers found they were able to create a field pattern which emanated from a virtual version of the 21st wire that ran not through the middle of the cylinder but, rather, 2cm outside it. In other words, if the apparatus doing the generating were to be shielded from an observer, Wizard of Oz-style, by a curtain, it would look to that observer as if this field was appearing from nowhere. Going from Dr Mach-Batlle’s demonstration to something which could be used in practice to manipulate distant magnetic fields will be a long journey. But if that journey can be made, potential applications go way beyond cleaning up fuzzy mri scans. Remotely cast fields of this sort might be used to steer medical nanobots through someone’s bloodstream to deliver drugs to a particular tissue, or else to guide them towards a malignant tumour and remotely raise their temperature once they have arrived, in order to cook it to death. There are also likely to be applications in quantum computing. Many designs for quantum computers rely on trapping atoms at precise locations in space—a difficult feat which this sleight of hand could simplify. The trick still requires refining. To achieve such desired applications the team need to be able to sculpt intricate magnetic fields in three dimensions. At present, limited as they are to emulating the field generated by a single electric wire, they cannot do this. But it is worth remembering that Oersted’s original experiment, from which the whole of electrical engineering ultimately descends, was even simpler. It involved only a battery, a magnetic compass and a single wire. Great oaks from little acorns grow.
Broken New Year's Resolutions Already? It's OK to Give Yourself A Break | It's mid-January, and maybe you've resolved to lose 20 pounds this year, exercise every day, or quit drinking. And — so far — you have failed. So you give up. Sound familiar? Every new year, we are bombarded with messages like "new year, new you," but for many of us, just living through the last several months has been a major accomplishment. This year, it's OK to give ourselves a break, says Dr. Rachelle Scott, director of psychiatry at Eden Health, a concierge-style health care start-up with offices in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. "There are days we're just getting up and showering and, you know, just doing basic activities of daily living. And that's OK," she says. We are far too hard on ourselves. "There are periods in time where we really need rest and we really need to heal. And I think we're in a time where that's certainly the case." Recharge your body It's a uniquely trying time to be a human right now. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll conducted in mid-July 2020 found 53% of adults in the U.S. reported that their mental health has been negatively impacted due to stress over COVID-19. That's up from 32% in March. Many adults also report difficulty sleeping (36%) or eating (32%), and are increasing their alcohol consumption or substance use (12%). For health care workers who see COVID-19 patients every day, that percentage may be even higher, according to a survey by the University of Utah Health published this month, and higher still for those who fear they don't have enough food to eat. And then there's the added stress of recent racial unrest and political riots at the U.S. Capitol. "You've got the chronic COVID-19 [stress] response and then you've got the acute layer on top of that," Scott says. "If you're just trying to be more productive on top of exhaustion, that only leads to one place, and that's burnout or depression," she says. And yet, many of us are still pushing. It's how we're wired. We want this kind of "mental accounting" every new year. So after you rest a bit, if you feel ready to work towards some big goals, these mental health experts offer some ideas for how to approach them in a calmer, gentler fashion for 2021: Reset your expectations This year might be a good time to look internally for goals, says Jacklynne Marder, an associate family and marriage therapist in Los Angeles. Marder works with a lot of Millennials who define themselves by their productivity and their ability to hustle. Because of the pandemic, many of them are now isolated from family members, out of work, or juggling small children who are learning from home. Sometimes they're doing all three. So try "practicing mindfulness or practicing having a more positive attitude with the current state of the world," she says. Instead of focusing on external values, ask yourself: "What makes someone a good person ... beyond how much money they make, beyond their Instagram followers, how many sit ups they did in a day?" she says. Everything that's going on can actually be a gift or a blessing in disguise, Marder says. "It can be an opportunity to really practice being more present." Science suggests that small acts of kindness — like actually listening to someone else — can make them feel loved and supported. Also, think about why you're making these resolutions or goals, says psychiatrist Scott. Think about what and who matters to you most. What is it that you think losing 20 pounds is going to achieve? Maybe your doctor told you to lose the weight because of your cholesterol, or maybe it's just that you think you'll be happier, she says. Try practicing gratitude, which improves our relationships and is good for our hearts. Say thank you — even if it's only to yourself. Gratitude is not pretending everything's great, it's just a way of looking at the positive side, says Scott — a reset. For example, instead of berating yourself for not completing four tasks on your to-do-list, try focusing on the fact that you accomplished six of them, she says. If you've got a big goal, consider breaking it down into smaller parts. "Break it down into 12 steps so that the beginning of each month is an opportunity to continue to work on that goal," Scott says. Choose something specific, short-term and positive, agrees Randi Kofsky, a Los Angeles-based marriage and family therapist who is also a somatic psychotherapist focusing on the mind-body connection. Let's say you want to eat more healthfully, "plan to eat more vegetables for three days. Then plan for another seven to 10 days. Assess the pros and cons of eating more vegetables. Then add another segment of days," she suggests. "The more we can stay engaged in the moment-to-moment process, the more our system notes the shifts we are attempting to make and works to maintain them." Reframe how you see success "Goals are not a program we follow," Kofsky adds "They are not a task master. They are a destination. When we map out the path to take one step at a time, goals become our guide in the process." We live in a very outcome-oriented society, so we don't always see that the journey to reach the goals can be rewarding, too, she says. For example, sharing a new skill with others or getting support from people who are working with you towards the same goals. With all the stress we're carrying right now, "just meeting ourselves where we're at is important," says Marden.
Conifer Cuisine: Don't Toss Your Christmas Tree Yet! Here's How You Can Cook With It | If you haven't taken down your Christmas tree yet, no worries. We don't judge. But here's an idea: Have you ever thought about eating it? Like, mmm, that would be good with my salmon. Well, maybe not. Still, Julia Georgallis has some recipes. Over the last five years, she's been orchestrating Christmas dinners in London with a friend. "How can we make something sustainable around Christmas time? What can we eat? What's the thing that no one eats that kind of represents Christmas? And then we just settled on Christmas trees," Georgallis says. She turned it into a book, How to Eat Your Christmas Tree. And her idea is that it's not that weird. Some people enjoy Christmas tree cocktails. Some people like to forage and most people can get behind saving the planet. "What I aimed for this book to do, really, was to get people thinking about the odd ways that they can be more sustainable in their daily lives," Georgallis says. "Eating Christmas trees isn't going to save any turtles or freeze any ice caps. But if we start to think about everything that we do as a whole, then that builds up, you know, and that helps," she says. Most of the recipes in her book use the needles from the tree. "You'd use the needles like a herb," she says. "And different Christmas trees kind of have different flavors. They're quite subtle, but they do have different flavors. So spruce is quite almost like vanilla in a way. Fir, which is a really popular choice of Christmas trees, is quite zesty. And then you have pine, which is a little bit more floral, a little bit more delicate." But Georgallis also thought of other ways to use that Christmas tree. "So there's pine nuts so that a lot of people don't associate Christmas trees with, but from your Christmas tree. You can also basically char the entire tree and you can use it to do ash cooking, which is much easier than it sounds." A warning: Some Christmas trees are poisonous if eaten — like cypress, cedars and yews. And be sure your tree wasn't sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals. "So if you have any doubt that you're that your Christmas tree might not have been grown to eat, then maybe don't eat it," Georgallis says. And, of course, don't even think about eating your artificial tree! So, with all those caveats and with the appropriate tree, what could we cook? Well, Georgallis' book has all sorts of recipes for fish, lamb, squash and ice cream. And pickles made with Christmas tree vinegar. The recipe works best with old dried trees. Take a 2-liter jar and good-quality vinegar — Georgallis suggests cider vinegar or white vinegar and 200 grams, or 7 ounces, of Christmas tree needles. She explains: "Sterilize your jar you're going to use, chop up the needles. And then pour the vinegar into a large saucepan and heat it until it's warm but not quite boiling. And then add the needles to sterilized jar and pour the vinegar over that. And then you just close up your jar and leave that to infuse, probably for up to three months. "You'll know that you're done because all your needles kind of start to sink to the bottom of the jar. Your Christmas tree vinegar keeps. And you can give that to people the following years as a nice gift." So, thanks to Georgallis, not only can you eat your tree, you can regift it too.
Americans Are Drinking More During The Pandemic. Here's How To Cut Back | When the pandemic began spreading across the U.S. in March, stores, restaurants and schools closed down. But liquor stores in many parts of the U.S. were deemed essential and stayed open. Alcohol sales have ticked up during the pandemic, so maybe it's a good time to ask yourself: Are you drinking more than you'd like to be? For many people, alcohol is a part of everyday life, but taking a break has its benefits. Here at Life Kit we've covered how to drink less in a pre-pandemic world — one where you might find yourself at a party or happy hour with co-workers. But with many of us stuck at home and bars either fully closed or with limited hours, we wanted to get some updated advice from the experts. Here's what they say: Think about why you drink. Kamala Greene Génecé, a psychologist who specializes in addiction, says it's important to look at the role alcohol plays in your life. "That will allow you to make specific changes based on the information that you gather," she says. There's no need for judgment, but R. Lorraine Collins, a psychologist at the University of Buffalo, recommends asking yourself, "Are you keeping alcohol as ... a special beverage for limited situations, or are you engaging in alcohol use across the board?" Track how much you drink. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that if you drink, you should do it moderately: up to one drink a day for women or two drinks for men. But Collins says sometimes people can get confused by what constitutes a drink. "For many people ... in their minds, a glass equals a drink," she says. So it's important to assess not just what alcohol you're consuming but how you're consuming it. Is your glass of wine really just 5 ounces (which equates one drink) or is it more? Mixed drinks often contain more than one shot, and craft beers can contain more alcohol than a standard beer. When you do drink, be mindful. Collins says there are a couple of tricks to curb your alcohol consumption — that way, you won't suddenly be on your fourth or fifth drink without even realizing it. To slow down consumption, Collins recommends sipping, not guzzling. "Even a beer can be sipped like fine wine," she says. Additionally, she recommends adding in nonalcoholic beverages between that cocktail or beer and having food available when you drink. Reprogram your day. Replace happy hour with a new habit. If you want to take a temporary break from drinking, Génecé recommends starting with a two-week hiatus. She says this will give you a lot of information about your relationship to alcohol: Was it a breeze, or was it really difficult to cut alcohol out of your routine? If the latter is true, she says it's important to replace drinking with new habits. So, for example, if you like to have a drink after work, try something else at that time, such as going for a walk or watching a show you like. "Substitute other pleasant activities during that very same time for at least two to three weeks so that you can begin to develop a new conditioned response," she says. Connection is key. Seek out support. Génecé says one of the silver linings of the pandemic is that many of the alcohol support groups such as Alcoholic Anonymous, Smart Recovery and Recovery Dharma have extensive online communities now. For people trying to take a break from drinking, online AA meetings or other similar groups can help you learn more about the help and support available — and meet other people who don't drink. Even if this more structured assistance isn't for you, getting support in some form helps — even if it's just something to distract you from your old routine, such as joining a remote book club or calling an old friend. Consider a break as an opportunity to learn more about yourself. A break from alcohol can lead to a range of outcomes. As we've reported, a 2016 British study of people who participated in a monthlong "Dry January" break, found that 82% said they felt a sense of achievement. "Better sleep" was cited by 62%, and 49% said they lost some weight. Génecé says try to take notice any positive changes in your life without alcohol — maybe you hike farther, have better conversations or get better sleep. Notice if your life feels richer to you. If we're stuck at home for now, why not give it a try? What do you have to lose?"
'We're In A War With This Virus': Biden Lays Out COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Plan | On Friday afternoon, President-Elect Joe Biden shared a detailed plan to tackle the COVID-19 vaccination rollout, promising to fight the pandemic with "the full strength of the federal government." In a speech in Delaware, Biden laid out his five-part plan for how to speed up the vaccination campaign: Open up vaccine eligibility to more people; create more vaccination sites; increase vaccine supply; hire a vaccination workforce; and launch a large-scale public education campaign. He called for Americans to do their part to end the pandemic by wearing masks and keeping up social distancing as the vaccine rollout ramps up. "We're in a war with this virus," he said. Biden's plan emphasizes the need to jump-start a slow vaccine rollout he called "a dismal failure." The COVID-19 vaccination campaign has reached just 3% of the U.S. population so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first step in the plan, he said, is to "immediately work with states to open up vaccinations to more priority groups." He called on states to expand eligibility to the vaccine to all front-line, essential workers and those over 65. These guidelines are generally in line with priority recommendations from the CDC's federal advisory committee but appear to push back the rollout of vaccines to people with underlying conditions — a vast, undefined group the Trump administration had urged states to prioritize earlier this week. Biden also pledged to use data to ensure equitable distribution in hard-hit communities and to build partnerships with community organizations. To expand the availability of vaccines, his administration intends to have the Federal Emergency Management Agency set up more vaccination sites across the nation to vaccinate millions of people in places such as school gymnasiums, sports stadiums and community centers. To increase vaccine supply, Biden said he would use the Defense Production Act to up the production of items related to vaccine distribution, such as syringes and protective equipment. He also plans to release nearly all the vaccine supply as it becomes available. "Right now, we are hearing [state and local governments] cannot plan. They do not know how much supply of vaccines they can expect, in what time frame. That stops when we are in office," Biden said. This week, states had expected to see a large jump in their vaccine allocations, after after Health Secretary Alex Azar pledged on Tuesday to release all vaccine doses held in reserve. But governors are now expressing disappointment, as they're learning that the reserve supply is already depleted. In a development first reported by the Washington Post and confirmed by NPR, government officials started quietly shipping out that reserve supply in late December, as their confidence in vaccine supply improved. Few doses remained in reserve by the time Azar made the announcement this week. Biden also promised to be open with the public and to launch a large-scale public health outreach campaign to address vaccine hesitancy with factual information. "We will always be honest and transparent about where we stand, both the good news as well as the bad news," he said. Biden cautioned this rollout may take "many months to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles." And of course, much of the plan will depend on Congress passing funding, which he said he is optimistic will happen. "I am convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort and no expense to get this done," he said. "This is going to be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country, but you have my word: We will manage the hell out of this operation." The details of Biden's vaccination plan accompany a larger relief proposal that he unveiled Thursday, called the American Rescue Plan, asking for $1.9 trillion in spending. Public health experts are broadly supportive of his approach but say Biden's calls for a speedy bipartisan deal mean that parts of the plan will likely be scaled back. As part of the relief package, he calls for hundreds of billions of spending for the national vaccination program as well as other public health measures to fight the virus, such as testing and contact tracing; new jobs for public health workers; and expanded U.S. manufacturing for protective gear. "This is the time for big, ambitious goals," says Lindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University, "It's the right place to start." The American Rescue Plan is ambitious not just in its spending goals but also in its intent to mitigate the pandemic's rippling effects, says Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. "There's funding here to empower people to be able to stay home [if they're sick], to get kids back in the school. There's money here to support the economy, to get workers back to work. When you couple that with these health interventions [such as testing and contact tracing], this is really a way forward," Benjamin says. Biden assumes control next week of a country facing a raging pandemic that is killing nearly 3,500 people every day on average, with the risk of potentially faster-spreading new virus strains on the horizon. Biden's proposed plan funds 100,000 new community health workers, creating a workforce for tasks such as vaccine outreach and contact tracing that could transform public health in the U.S., Wiley says: "If we can engage a new, young energetic workforce ... it could really put public health practice, public health infrastructure on good footing for a generation to come, like we saw with the Public Works Administration for past generations." The plan shows that Biden intends to take firm leadership of the pandemic response, health experts say. "[He's saying] here's my plan for distribution. Here's my plan for vaccination," says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the nonprofit American Action Forum, a conservative think tank: "If he takes ownership of this in a way that his predecessor never did, that can really raise the chances of it being successful." He adds that he thinks there's going to be consensus in Congress around funding vaccine distribution and other measures to combat the virus. As it stands, the proposed rescue package would be the second largest in history, after the $2 trillion CARES Act passed in March. Health care experts expect it to be pared down as it gets debated in Congress. "It's an opening bid on what is necessary in the spring and early summer of 2021 to help people survive the financial fallout of the virus, but more importantly, to combat the ravages of the virus," Holtz-Eakin says. Holtz-Eakin lauds Biden's intent to move with "urgency and bipartisanship" to pass his American Rescue Plan — and says that also means compromises are coming. He anticipates pushback on measures such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and funding for state and local governments. "There is a case to be made for this. How big will always be in the eye of the beholder," Holtz-Eakin says, "In the end, some [parts of the proposal] will drop out, some of it will get scaled back."
2020 May Be The Hottest Year On Record. Here's The Damage It Did | With just a few weeks left, 2020 is in a dead-heat tie for the hottest year on record. But whether it claims the top spot misses the point, climate scientists say. There is no shortage of disquieting statistics about what is happening to the Earth. The hottest decade on record is coming to a close, with the last five years being the hottest since 1880. 2020 is just two-hundredths of a degree cooler than 2016, the hottest year ever recorded. The Earth is nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer now than it was in the 20th century, and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are still rising. The future will be even hotter, although humans, through the choices governments, corporations and individuals make, will decide exactly how much. That means more years like 2020, with increasingly powerful hurricanes, more intense wildfires, less ice and longer heat waves. The average yearly number of $1 billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. has quadrupled in the last three decades. As of October 2020, there had been 16 climate-driven disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage each. "How many times can we say the word 'unprecedented'?" says Kristina Dahl, climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "This is not just something theoretical that we're predicting. It's something that we are living through and that we're already beginning to see." Climate-driven disasters — hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, droughts and floods — affect every region of the U.S., but poor people and poor places suffer disproportionately. Around the world, climate change is exacerbating inequality. As President-elect Joe Biden assembles a new administration that promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help people across the country, and around the world, adapt to global warming, NPR's Climate Team asked climate scientists what lessons can be learned at the end of another hot year. That's because many cities endured lengthy stretches of relentless heat, breaking long-term temperature records. Phoenix, Arizona experienced a record-breaking 145 days above 100 degrees, the repeated, sustained heat waves made worse by a lack of rain. The city also had 15 days above 115 degrees, double the previous record. "Basically almost everything set records," says Marvin Percha, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Phoenix. "I've lived here a long time. I grew up here in the 70s and I've never seen anything quite like this." Heat can have deadly consequences. Phoenix also broke the record for the number of heat-related deaths, with almost 300 people dying. Some were killed directly by the heat, while others suffered from cardiac and respiratory problems triggered by heat stress. Cities, with their vast amounts of concrete, also experience higher temperatures than surrounding areas — what's known as the "urban heat island" effect. Nighttime temperatures are warming faster than daytime temperatures, which provides less respite from the heat. Other cities like Palm Springs and Sacramento, Calif. also broke their records for the number of days above 100 and 90 degrees, respectively. Climate scientists say even small changes in average temperature translate to large increases in extremes. Drought and heat feed a vicious spiral, drying out soils and plants which then lead to hotter air temperatures around them. "Certainly with the overall warmer Earth it makes it more likely to get these extremes temperatures," Percha says. Jackie Grebmeier has been traveling to the Arctic every summer for more than 30 years. A climate scientist at the University of Maryland, she studies how the oceans are changing, and what that means for people and animals. This year the pandemic got in the way. It was October before Grebmeier and a pared down group of Arctic scientists made it to the Bering Strait near Alaska. Grebmeier expected much colder weather than she usually experiences during summer research trips, but was surprised by the warm conditions she found. "All the long johns we brought, we didn't need them," she says. "We saw not one piece of ice." At one point, the scientists on the research vessel saw a container ship coming south through the Bering Strait. It had started in Canada and was headed for South Korea, via the Arctic Ocean. They also found evidence of a large algae bloom off the coast of northern Alaska. Usually, such blooms only occur in the summer. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the Earth, according to the federal government's 2020 Arctic Report Card. That means sea ice is melting earlier in the spring and freezing later in the fall. Permanently frozen ground is melting, and wildfires in boreal forests and Arctic shrublands are getting more frequent and severe. There was less Arctic sea ice this October than any previous October on record. That comes as no surprise to many people who live in the Arctic. "You know, climate change for indigenous people is not anything new. It's maybe new for science to say, 'Yeah the Arctic is warming, there's a lack of sea ice,' " says Mellisa Johnson, the director of the Bering Sea Elders Group, which is made up of representatives from more than 40 communities on the Alaska coast. Johnson says many indigenous people are already adapting hunting practices to accommodate for less sea ice, and the new ways of gathering traditional food are being passed down to younger generations. But the climate models that scientists use to predict the future do not accurately predict how quickly ice in the Arctic is melting. "Many models seem to have difficulties in reproducing what we're seeing in the Arctic," says Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, a climate scientist at the University of Copenhagen. Faced with obviously rapid Arctic warming, scientists are trying to figure out why that is. Climate models are particularly crucial in the Arctic because there is less directly observed data available. In a 2020 study, Hesselbjerg Christensen and his colleagues analyzed how quickly the Arctic is warming now compared to dramatic temperature changes in the distant past, such as when the last Ice Age ended, and found that what's happening now is comparably fast. "The amount of warming that's taking place is quite comparable to what happened at the top of Greenland like 30,000 years ago," he says. "This is almost as abrupt as anything gets." Now, scientists like Hesselbjerg Christensen are trying to understand what that means for the future, and whether the past could help them design climate models that reflect what's actually happening in the Arctic. "It's not about what happens this year," Hesselbjerg Christensen says. "It's about what happens next year and the year after and the year after that." The West is no stranger to fires, but this year's blazes seemed relentless. More than nine million acres burned and 17,000 homes and buildings were destroyed. Three states experienced the largest wildfires in their recorded history: California, Oregon and Colorado. The pattern was unsettlingly similar across those states: extreme hot weather and high winds created explosive infernos that sent people fleeing their homes with just minutes to spare. As multiple fires burned, fire-fighting crews were stretched thin with little relief. No state could spare extra personnel to help their Western neighbors. Millions of people inhaled unhealthy air for weeks, as the smoke spread to places far and wide that had not had wildfires. Extreme fires can have many causes that lead to their destructiveness. Many ecosystems are overgrown with brush, after years of land management practices that focused on extinguishing fires rather than letting them clear out vegetation when safe to do so. At the same time, millions of people have moved into fire-prone landscapes where fires are a regular part of the ecology. But climate scientists say the warming climate set the stage for fires to get out of hand. California experienced the hottest October on record. Many parts of the Southwest had the driest late summer ever recorded. That created an extremely "thirsty" atmosphere — a key metric that scientists track to measure fire danger. When the air is hot and dry, it acts like a sponge, drawing moisture out of soils and plants. That dry vegetation is highly flammable, creating the conditions for explosive fires. Climate scientists say as temperatures continue to rise, the West will see more and more days with high fire danger due to a "thirstier" atmosphere. "That's what we saw this year," says Dan McEvoy, climatologist with the Western Regional Climate Center and Desert Research Institute. "We saw a record high and it was almost double compared to the previous record. So we're seeing this play out in real time." With the potential for catastrophic fires only increasing, fire experts say Western communities must reduce the risk where they can. That means changing their relationship with fire by using it as a tool. Setting controlled burns in the winter season can help reduce overgrown fuels, as Native American tribes have done for millennia. Making homes and buildings more resistant to fire with better building materials gives them a chance to survive wildfires or at least slow them down. While that's required in risky areas in California, many Western states have failed to institute wildfire building codes. Given the speed of wildfires this past year, evacuation plans are more critical than ever. "Fire on the landscape in the West is normal," McEvoy says. "We need that fire. But the thing that's changing is the rate that they spread and how quickly they become these large mega-fires." 
2 Gorillas In California Contract The Coronavirus | Members of a troop of gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, Calif., have tested positive for the coronavirus. Last Wednesday, two of the gorillas developed a cough and showed other mild symptoms, a news release says. Park staff tested the animals. A fecal examination detected the virus last Friday, and the results were confirmed by the Agriculture Department's National Veterinary Services Laboratories on Monday. "Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well," said Executive Director Lisa Peterson. "The troop remains quarantined together and are eating and drinking. We are hopeful for a full recovery." Park staff members have been taking measures since the onset of the pandemic last year to avoid contamination. Staff members wear masks and wash their hands frequently. They even have dedicated uniforms that must be worn while working around wildlife. Despite these precautions, park officials suspect the gorillas contracted the virus from an asymptomatic worker. San Diego Zoo Global, which owns the park, says the infected gorillas pose no threat to the public. The park is currently closed to visitors, and even under normal operating circumstances, there is no logical reason guests would come into contact with a 300-pound gorilla. This is the first known natural transmission of the coronavirus to great apes, the news release says. But other animals were infected with the virus last year. Last spring, a four-year-old Malayan tiger in New York was the first animal in the U.S. to test positive for the coronavirus. And in Denmark, the government killed an estimated 17 million minks in November after discovering they could carry the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that cats and dogs can also become infected. Studies to understand how the coronavirus affects different animals are ongoing, and it is unclear whether some animals can spread the infection to people, the CDC said.
We All Know Smoke Is Bad For Your Health. It Could Be Worse Than You Think | It's no secret that inhaling smoke is bad for your lungs. But now, scientists are suggesting smoke may also carry and spread infectious diseases. The theory, published in Science Magazine, is based on research that found wildfire smoke is teeming with thousands of species of microorganisms. Some of these microorganisms, including bacteria and fungal spores, are known to cause disease. Until now, it's been widely accepted that the greatest risk to human health from smoke are the tiny particles from burning wood and other materials. Some of those particles are small enough to be inhaled into the lungs, triggering allergic reactions in some people or exacerbating lung diseases such as asthma in others. The new research posits that when a wildfire burns plant or animal matter and disturbs soils, it exposes thousands of species of bacteria and fungi that otherwise might not easily become airborne. You might think the high heat from fire would kill these organisms, but one study cited in the article found that some bacteria even multiply post-fire. Scientists say the organisms latch onto smoke particulates, allowing them to travel thousands of miles across continents. The possibility that smoke-transported microbes may be contributing to infections in human populations has yet to be studied. But it should be, the authors of the article argue. In some locations, growing rates of fungal diseases have coincided with increasing wildfire smoke — what the authors of the article call "compelling overlaps." The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also warns that firefighters are at higher risk of contracting valley fever, an infection caused by inhaling a fungus found in soil. "I think that the connections haven't been made in the past because it's a very new idea to think of smoke as having a living component," says Leda Kobziar, co-author of the article and associate professor of wildland fire science at the University of Idaho. Kobziar hopes that doctors and scientists will devote more research to whether prolonged smoke exposure can cause infections and whether the spread of disease can be predicted from smoke patterns. Dr. Peter Chen, director of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, is "intrigued" by the theory but somewhat skeptical that the microorganisms in smoke would actually cause infections. Many bacteria and fungi don't cause lung infections, says Chen, but it's certainly possible that a significant dose could exacerbate symptoms in someone with a preexisting lung condition. "I always thought it was the particulates in smoke that were causing these issues," says Chen, "but when I read this, I started thinking could it be the microorganisms that are also causing exacerbations?" Whether the microbes in smoke actually cause infection or simply aggravate underlying respiratory issues, the article raises a new health threat that is "certainly alarming," says Kelsey Jack, an associate professor of environmental and development economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara and co-chair of the climate group at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab. This is especially true for lower-income populations, Jack says, because people with fewer means are often more exposed to the environment. If smoke is affecting the air quality in a certain area, the people who work outside, or who have to commute by foot or bike, will inhale more smoke than those who commute by car to their office jobs. Additionally, air pollution tends to be worse in developing countries — meaning those populations have a lower baseline for respiratory health. Pneumonia is the No. 1 cause of death in children under 5 years old, and respiratory disease and infections are a leading cause of death among aging adults in poorer nations. Jack says it would also be helpful to study whether smoke from other common sources in developing countries — such as indoor cooking fires or stubble burning, when farmers set their fields on fire after harvest season to clear them — contain as many infectious microbes as wildfires. And if so, whether it's contributing to disease in those populations. "To the extent that this is a missing piece of understanding the relationship between an emission source and a health impact, it is very, very valuable," says Jack. But until more research is done, Chen says the best thing people can do is just follow existing recommendations when air quality is poor — including staying indoors, keeping windows and doors closed, using HEPA filters and running air conditioning. "Really, we just want people to scrub the air," says Chen. According to the article, further study is especially relevant as climate change will likely make smoky skies a "seasonal norm rather than a rare event" in places around the world. "Given the fact that we will be living with smoke, we would just encourage people to take precautions," says Kobziar.
Need A Break? The Pets And Vets Of 'All Creatures Great And Small' Might Hit The Spot | When young veterinarian James Herriot first opened his eyes and saw the richly green hills around Darrowby in the new adaptation of All Creatures Great And Small, I felt my shoulders drop. When he saw the village tucked — it must be said — adorably into the valley between them, I felt my breathing slow. Darrowby is the fictional setting for the real James Herriot's books about his life as a vet in Yorkshire, England, and the new All Creatures Great And Small that arrived on PBS on Sunday night after a successful run in the UK is the second television version of those stories to feature a fictionalized Herriot (here played by Nicholas Ralph) joining the veterinary practice of Siegfried Farnon (Samuel West) and, eventually, Siegfried's brother Tristan (Callum Woodhouse). The first version ran from 1978 to 1990, and while I remember almost nothing about it, it's one of the shows that formed my general impression of PBS shows when I was young: gentle, calm, funny without a laugh track, and very popular with parents, mine included. And now, as a person older than they were at the time, I have — not for the first time — come around to their way of thinking. The new All Creatures Great And Small is, above all else, soothing. Not because it is mindless or merely distracting, but because the slice of humanity that it focuses on is a slice taken from the better rather than the worst of what we can be. Is this a lot to ask of a show that adapts stories about taking care of animals in a beautiful setting in 1930s England? Maybe. But for all its simplicity, it has a real and resonant core, in that the drama comes not from external and fanciful circumstances, but from the day-to-day matters of family and work. The family here is Herriot, the two Farnons, and Mrs. Hall (Anna Madeley), who takes care of Siegfried's house, where they all live and where the veterinary practice is located. The first season, which consists of six episodes and the beloved traditional Christmas episode (an idea the UK embraces and American television usually doesn't, to its detriment), establishes this family with its loving but complicated relationships. The stories are focused as much on mentoring and teaching and caring for people — and the drama and comedy that naturally follow — as so many shows are on harming and forgiving and enabling people. There is something to be said for the realism of television that reminds us uncannily of our worst and most toxic relationships; this is television meant to remind us of the contours of our best ones. As played by Ralph, who gets the rarely-seen "introducing" credit, James Herriot is a nervous but committed young vet who leaves home and family in Glasgow to take one of the few vet jobs that's open now that the world is turning from horses to cars: the Yorkshire practice of Siegfried Farnon. Siegfried sees cows and bulls, working horses and racehorses, sheep and goats, cats and dogs, and birds and ferrets. He is the vet in Darrowby, and they're all his responsibility — especially since he tends to toss his assistants in short order. He's haughty but also dryly funny, and Mrs. Hall's obvious fondness for him, while it calls to mind a lot of other housekeeper-homeowner relationships of fiction, helps to humanize him. Shortly after James arrives, Siegfried's ne'er-do-well brother Tristan blows back into town after failing his vet school exams. Siegfried practically raised Tristan from adolescence, so this sets up a dynamic in which if you squint, Siegfried and Mrs. Hall (whose name is Audrey, it will turn out) are the parents, and James and Tristan are the sons: the older one responsible and shy, the younger one brash and charming and prone to screwing up. So really, what unfolds is a chosen-family story, with dashes of cute dogs and pregnant cows and an underlying recognition that animals, for many residents of Darrowby, are the most important property they own as well as revered living creatures. The reason a vet in Yorkshire is such a rich well of stories is not only because animals are interesting or they get a lot of weird diseases. It's because in a farming community, animals are adjacent to wealth, to power, to business, to sport, to families, to children, to making a living. They are adjacent to everything important, so vets know the rich and the poor, the honest and the dishonest. Siegfried's practice is everything to this community. In fact, one of the best episodes finds James doing his first turn as the vet at the local fair, measuring ponies and judging the pet contest, and it reminded me a pinch — just a pinch — of the episode of Schitt's Creek where the family winds up dancing in the barn. It is about what it means to be joined to a community, with all its joys and frustrations. There are, unsurprisingly, women other than Audrey who come into the lives of the three men. The only one it seems sporting to discuss is Helen Alderson (Rachel Shenton), who lives on one of the farms Herriot visits. Helen is independent and capable (at most things), but also funny and observant, and she seems a bit fascinated by the new vet's assistant. PBS will be running these episodes once a week through the rest of January and February (and making them available on demand), and when you reach the end, there is another sigh, just like the one that comes with the first view of the rolling hills. It's the satisfaction of a well-designed first season of what I hope will be a long run. Particularly at a time when rest is important and exhaling is important, perhaps a beautiful setting, some fine performances and a high regard for what happens inside a home between people who care for each other will be just what the (ahem) doctor ordered.
Trump administration accused of deception in pledging release of vaccine stockpile |  The governors of several states accused the Trump administration on Friday of deception in pledging to immediately distribute millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses from a stockpile that the U.S. health secretary has since acknowledged does not exist. Confusion over a vaccine supply windfall that was promised to governors but failed to materialize arose as scattered shortages emerged on the frontlines of the most ambitious and complex immunization campaign in U.S. history, prompting at least one large New York healthcare system to cancel a slew of inoculation appointments. Just 10.6 million Americans have received a shot since federal regulators last month granted emergency approval to two vaccines, one from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech and a second from Moderna Inc, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. That tally falls far short of the 20 million vaccinations the Trump administration had promised to administer by the end of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged virtually unchecked with ever-increasing record numbers of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each require an initial dose and a booster shot given about three weeks apart. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar had said on Tuesday that the administration would release millions of doses it had been holding in reserve for booster shots in order to help spur a sluggish rollout of first doses to those most in need of the vaccine. Azar said then that the administration was confident enough in the supply chain to release its stockpile, and urged states to use the additional supply to open inoculations to everyone aged 65 and over. Many states obliged, but on Friday a number of governors said they were dismayed to learn that no stockpile existed. The Washington Post reported on Friday that the federal government ran down its vaccine reserve in late December and has no remaining reserves of doses on hand. California Governor Gavin Newsom, appearing at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for the opening of a mass-inoculation site, said Azar and Vice President Mike Pence had committed on a conference call this week with governors to releasing a vaccine reserve that Newsom said had included some 50 million doses stored in Michigan. “And then we read, as everybody else, that they have reneged on that, or for whatever reason are unable to deliver on that,” Newsom said. Brown and Newsom’s comments were echoed by at least eight other governors, most of them fellow Democrats, including Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who called the situation a “slap in the face.” Colorado Governor Jared Polis said he was “extremely disappointed” that Azar had “lied to” his state. Azar suggested in an interview with NBC News on Friday that the doses in question had already been allocated to the states. “We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people,” the HHS secretary said. “So we’re not sitting on a reserve anymore. We’ve made that available to the states to order.” Pfizer said it has been holding on to second doses at the request of the federal government and anticipated no problems supplying them to Americans. “Operation Warp Speed has asked us to start shipping second doses only recently. As a result, we have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the U.S.,” a company spokeswoman said in a statement. The latest stumble in the vaccine campaign came as the number of known U.S. infections of the virus that causes COVID-19 surpassed 23 million, more than 388,000 of which have proven fatal, according to a Reuters tally. Adding to anxieties over the pace of immunizations, the CDC warned on Friday that a new, highly transmissible variant of the virus sweeping Britain could become the dominant form in the United States by March. In New York, the country’s most populous city, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city has vaccinated about 300,000 of its more than 8 million residents, but was on course to run dry next week because it was burning through vaccines faster than they were being replenished. At least one New York City healthcare system, Mount Sinai Hospital, canceled vaccination appointments, and another, NYU Langone Health, suspended new ones amid shortages, officials said. In Los Angeles, Governor Newsom joined Mayor Eric Garcetti and other officials in launching a mass inoculation site at Dodger Stadium, an operation they said would be the largest in the nation, administering 12,000 shots a day by next week. The baseball arena, which had been devoted to drive-through diagnostic testing for months, is one of several vaccine “super stations” opening across California, home to 40 million people and a U.S. epicenter of the pandemic in recent weeks. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, said on Friday he would order increased production of syringes and other supplies to accelerate a vaccine rollout that he has called a “dismal failure.” He has set the goal of immunizing 100 million Americans, about a third of the population, within the first 100 days of his administration. “Last night I received disturbing news, confirmed to me directly by General (Gustave) Perna of Operation Warp Speed: states will not be receiving increased shipments of vaccines from the national stockpile next week, because there is no federal reserve of doses,” Oregon Governor Kate Brown said on Twitter. “This is a deception on a national scale,” Brown added, demanding an explanation from the outgoing administration.
Can't go to ski resort? South Koreans rush to buy sledges, enjoy sledding near home | With South Korea’s ski resorts closed in recent weeks to help combat COVID-19, heavy snowfalls have led to a surge in sales of sledges as winter sports lovers look for family friendly snow slopes close to home. Major retailers have run out of stocks of plastic sledges, with E-Mart, the country’s biggest supermarket chain, selling nearly 2,200 sledges in six days, more than three times its total 2020 sales. Competitor Lotte Mart said sales of sledges in the first six days of January were up more than six-fold from the same period last year and is also completely out of stock. One family that visited the Olympic Park in Seoul said they had to bring picnic mats for their children the slide on. “We tried to buy sledges yesterday but couldn’t find one, so we brought these mats as substitutes. It’s still great that our kids can enjoy sledding and that we have a place near home where it can replace the sledding parks,” said Joe Choong-hyun, a father of two boys. After heavy snowfalls earlier in the week, children played outdoors even as the temperature in Seoul plummeted to -18.6 Celsius (-1.5 Fahrenheit) on Friday, the coldest in 35 years. “I’m happy that the snow is still piled up so I can make more snowmen and have snowball fights,” said 11-year-old Kim Ha-jin, who was sledding on a small slope. A photo of a person snowboarding on a snow covered road in the middle of Seoul went viral on Twitter, while a Youtuber who posted a video of himself skiing around his town scored nearly 43,000 views. Ski resorts, meanwhile, resumed business earlier this week, but only with limited capacity and operating hours, following a cluster of infections at a resort in Pyeongchang county, site of the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Gaza man with disabilities conquers karate | Joussef Abu Amira, a Palestinian law school graduate, never let disabilities hold him back. Born without legs and with only partially developed arms, he has taken up a new challenge - karate. The 24-year-old orange belt showed his stick-fighting skills as he trained with his coach at Gaza’s Al-Mashtal Club for Martial Arts. “I wanted to prove to myself and the world that disability is in the mind and is not in the body and that nothing was impossible,” Abu Amira said. “I wanted to do karate so I can defend myself, and I dream of taking part in international championships.” His mastery of the stick helps him make up for his missing limbs, and he has learned how to deliver strong punches, and fend off attacks with his body and arms. Coach Hassan Al-Raai said his pupil showed particular determination. “I was surprised that Youssef has different skills and can do things better than people with fewer disabilities could do,” Al-Raai said. A resident of Gaza’s Beach refugee camp, Abu Amira travels along city streets in a motorised mobility scooter. He graduated from the Islamic University of Gaza’s College of Sharia and Law last year.
Thailand serves up cannabis cuisine to happy customers | “Giggling bread” and “joyfully dancing salad” aren’t the usual dishes on a menu in Thailand, but one eatery is hoping its cannabis-infused cuisine can lure foreign tourists and take the taboo out of the recently legalised leaf. The restaurant at the Chao Phya Abhaibhubejhr Hospital in Prachin Buri started serving its own happy meals this month, after Thailand de-listed cannabis as a narcotic, allowing state-authorised firms to cultivate the plant. “Cannabis leaves, when put in the food or even a small amount ... it will help the patient to recover faster from the illness,” said Pakakrong Kwankao, the project leader at the hospital. “The cannabis leaf can improve appetite and make people sleep well, and also be in a mood, in a good mood.” The hospital is known as a pioneer in Thailand for studying marijuana and its ability to relieve pain and fatigue. Thailand in 2017 became the first Southeast Asian country to legalise cannabis for medical use and has since opened numerous medical marijuana clinics. The restaurant’s offerings include a happy pork soup, deep-fried bread topped with pork and a marijuana leaf, and a salad of crispy cannabis leaves served with ground pork and chopped vegetables. “I’ve never taken cannabis before, it feels weird but it’s delicious,” said diner Ketsirin Boonsiri, adding it was “quite strange”. Nattanon Naranan said the taste of the cannabis leaves was similar to everyday vegetables, but the after-effects were quite different. “It makes my throat dry and I crave sweets,” she said. Thai deputy education minister Kanokwan Vilawan said the next step was to offer famous Thai dishes to reach an international audience. “We plan to add more (cannabis) to Thai dishes that are already well known, such as green curry soup, to boost the popularity of these dishes even more,” Kanokwan said.
"Why limit myself?" Polish climber aims to defy critics with K2 bid | Scaling the world’s second-highest peak, K2, in winter is one of the last great feats in mountaineering -- and despite what some see as a lack of experience, 28-year-old Pole Magdalena Gorzkowska wants to be the first to do it. If Gorzkowska, a medal-winning runner who also became the youngest Polish woman ever to climb Mount Everest, makes it to the summit, she will have made history and silenced those who see her attempt as a social media stunt with no chance of success. “Everyone can have their opinion, and some believe that it takes many years to be able to face such challenges. I just do what I feel I can do,” Gorzkowska told Reuters by telephone from her base camp. “Why should I limit myself?” Gorzkowska is one of several mountaineers attempting this winter to scale K2, which at 8,611 metres (28,251 feet) is second only to Mount Everest. Gorzkowska, who is being accompanied by sherpas, said she had returned to her base camp, at an altitude of 5,000 metres, after an acclimatisation trip that saw her spend a night at a camp at 6,550 metres. “The conditions were very difficult. The mountain gives you a hard time, it is very demanding. You have to climb hard all the time, the wind is very strong. It is at least minus 30 degrees non-stop,” she said. K2, in the Karakorum mountains along the border between China and Pakistan, is notorious for its high winds, especially steep and icy slopes, and a high fatality rate among climbers. Eighty six climbers are reported to have died on its slopes. Two years ago a Polish team abandoned their attempt to reach the summit in winter due to heavy snow. The scale of the challenge has made some in the male-dominated world of Polish mountaineering regard her bid with scepticism. “Just wait for the desire to attack K2 in winter to be announced by top Polish Youtubers, Instagrammers or other influencers,” Polish mountaineer Marcin Miotk said, on hearing the news of her attempt. Gorzkowska is unfazed by such comments. “I dreamt of K2 in winter and that’s why I’m here. Maybe they (her critics) don’t have dreams like that, maybe they aren’t so determined,” she said.
On thin ice? Poles get creative to skate round coronavirus rules | A skating rink owner in the Polish city of Szczecin believes he has found a way to keep his business open despite coronavirus restrictions - operate as a flower shop instead. His plan is simple - the customer has to purchase access to the flower “warehouse”, then chooses from a box of flowers in the middle of the rink. “You can jump, crawl or go on all fours ... you don’t have to wear skates,” Tomasz Fornalski, owner of the Lodogryf skating rink, told broadcaster TVN, which showed skaters holding pink roses as they circled the rink. His plan emerged as Poland imposed a three-week lockdown closing hotels, ski slopes, skating rinks and other businesses from Dec. 28 to stem the coronavirus. Poland weathered the first wave of the pandemic well compared to Western Europe, but faced a new spike in October and November. Officials said the current national quarantine was aimed at preventing a major third wave in coming months just as the country has started vaccinating people. Officials in Szczecin say Fornalski is breaking the rules. “A decision has been taken and communicated to the owner to stop this activity, and this decision is immediately enforceable,” Malgorzata Kaplan, a spokeswoman for Szczecin’s sanitary services, told TVN. Fornalski said he had yet to receive a formal notification. “Until we receive the administrative decision to halt our service, we will continue to operate,” he told the broadcaster. Fornalski is not the only one getting creative. A ski slope in the resort of Szczyrk is also continuing to operate its chair-lift for sledders instead of skiers in an attempt to get round the restrictions. TVN footage showed a slope full of sleds at the Skrzyczne ski resort, with even a few skiers going down the hill. Skrzyczne did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
Seven-year-old boy who adores Elon Musk is sensation on Ugandan aviation scene | A 7-year-old Ugandan boy has become a sensation in his country with his precocious display of aircraft knowledge and budding flying skills. Graham Shema has been interviewed on local television and his name is prefixed in newspapers and on social media with “Captain”. Germany’s ambassador and the country’s transport minister have invited him for meetings. A lover of math and science, the student has flown as a trainee three times on a Cessna 172. He says he wants to be a pilot and an astronaut, and someday travel to Mars. “My role model is Elon Musk,” said the boy, a pilot’s white shirt and black slacks hugging his small frame. “I like Elon Musk because I want to learn with him about space, to go with him in space and also to get a handshake.” Musk founded SpaceX and the private rocket company recently launched two Americans into orbit and hopes to one day send humans to Mars. One recent morning at Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport, his instructor asked him to explain how the engines worked on a Bombardier CRJ900 plane parked on the tarmac. His voice struggling to rise above the roar of a plane’s running engines, Shema rattled off the answer: “The inlet tubes suck in the air and inject it into the compressor, the compressor squeezes it with the fans, after squeezing it with the fans, it becomes hot,” Shema said, playfully gesturing and proceeding to detail how an engine creates thrust.Shema’s curiosity for flight was piqued by a freak incident. When he was 3 years old, a police helicopter flew so low to the ground that it blew off the roof of his grandmother’s house on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital Kampala while he was playing outside. “It triggered something in his mind,” said his mother, travel agent Shamim Mwanaisha, 29. Her son began peppering her with endless questions about how planes work, she said. Last year, she contacted a local aviation academy and Shema began lessons at home on aircraft parts and aviation vocabulary. After five months of coursework, Mwanaisha paid for practical flying lessons for her son. “I felt like a bird flying up,” Shema said of his first flight. He had never flown on a plane before. He flew three times as co-pilot between January and March before the pandemic stopped his practice. He has since been focusing on aviation theory, and immersing himself in videos about aviation and space exploration on his virtual reality viewer.
Magicians mark 100 years of sawing people in half | He came, he sawed, he conquered. One hundred years ago on Sunday, illusionist P.T. Selbit put a woman in a box on the stage of London’s Finsbury Park Empire and sawed right through the wood, creating a magical classic. Now, 100 years on, magicians from around the world will be getting together online this weekend to celebrate the centenary of that landmark performance. “This took off and became the most influential and the most famous illusion, in my opinion, that there’s ever been,” said magician and historian Mike Caveney who is writing a book on the illusion. “The magician wasn’t doing this trick to an inanimate object. He was doing it to a human being, which raised it up to a whole new level.” In the original version, the saw went through, the box was opened and the person emerged unharmed. Down the years magicians developed refinements, with the two halves pulled apart. Celebrity magician David Copperfield came up with his own version “The Death Saw” where he was the one tied down to a platform as a giant rotary blade sliced him in two. Sometimes he actually got injured, Copperfield said in an interview filmed for Sunday’s online event. “I got cut a few times by the blade because the blade was a little bit off, you know, stages are different every theatre you have,” Copperfield said. The London-based Magic Circle organisation will host the celebrations with a live streamed-event on Facebook from 1800 GMT on Sunday. Guests will include Debbie McGee, the wife of the late British TV magician Paul Daniels, who will describe the many times she survived the procedure.
Overcoming the 'yuck factor': Yellow grub becomes EU's first insect food | Mealworms may soon find their into Europe’s pasta bowls and dinner dishes, after becoming the first insect approved in the region as a human food. Wednesday’s decision by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) paves the way for the yellow grubs to be used whole and dried in curries and other recipes and as a flour to make biscuits, pasta and bread. Despite their name, mealworms are beetle larvae rather than worms and are already used in Europe as a pet food ingredient. Rich in protein, fat and fibre, they are likely to be the first of many insects to feature on European’s plates in the coming years, EFSA chemist and food scientist Ermolaos Ververis told Reuters. Under his supervision, mealworms were the first insect that the EU agency assessed under a “novel food” regulation that came into effect in 2018, triggering a flood of similar applications. “There is great interest of the scientific community and also the food industry in the edible insect sector,” he said. People across much of the world - including parts of Africa, Australia and New Zealand - already enjoy tucking into insect bars, cricket burgers and other grub-based foods. Once the European Commission ratifies ESFA’s endorsement, Europe will join them. Some sociologists, however, believe psychological barriers particularly strong in Europe mean it will be some time before the yellow worms start flying off supermarket shelves there. “There are cognitive reasons derived from our social and cultural experiences - the so-called ‘yuck factor’ - that make the thought of eating insects repellent to many Europeans,” said Giovanni Sogari, a social and consumer researcher at the University of Parma in Italy. “With time and exposure, such attitudes can change.” EFSA said it had received 156 applications for “novel food” safety assessments since 2018, covering everything from algae-derived foods to an array of insect species.
Stalin-themed cafe in Moscow closed after public outcry | A shawarma shop in Moscow was forced to close a day after it opened following an outcry over its provocative Josef Stalin-themed branding, the shop’s owner told Reuters on Saturday. The Stalin Doner shop featured a portrait of the controversial Communist leader above its front door. Inside, a man dressed in the Stalin-era security service uniform served customers meat wraps named after Soviet leaders. “We fully opened the day before yesterday and served around 200 customers,” shop owner Stanislav Voltman said. “There were no legal reasons (to close the shop),” he added, but said that police had forced him to remove the Stalin sign and then “colossal pressure” from local authorities forced him to shut completely. The branding was hotly debated on social media with some commenters condemning it as distasteful. Stalin’s rule was marked by mass repression, labour camps and famine. Nearly 700,000 people were executed during the Great Terror of 1936-38, according to conservative official estimates. However, many in the former Soviet Union still regard him primarily as the leader who defeated Nazi Germany in the Second World War, ensuring the country’s very existence. “I had expected some social media hype,” Voltman said. “But I had not expected that all TV stations, all the reporters and bloggers would flock here and queue up like they do in front of the Lenin mausoleum.”
Bonobos, much like humans, show commitment to completing a joint task | Bonobos display responsibility toward grooming partners akin to that of people working together on a task, a new study suggests. Until now, investigations have shown only that humans can work jointly toward a common goal presumed to require back-and-forth exchanges and an appreciation of being obligated to a partner . Primate biologist Raphaela Heesen of Durham University in England and colleagues studied 15 of the endangered great apes at a French zoological park. The researchers interrupted 85 instances of social grooming, in which one ape cleaned another’s fur, and 26 instances of self-grooming or solitary play.Interruptions consisted either of a keeper calling one bonobo in a grooming pair to come over for a food reward or a keeper rapidly opening and closing a sliding door to an indoor enclosure, which typically signaled mealtime and thus attracted both bonobos. Social grooming resumed, on average, 80 percent of the time after food rewards and 83 percent of the time after sliding-door disruptions, the researchers report December 18 in Science Advances. In contrast, self-grooming or playing alone was resumed only around 50 percent of the time, on average. Bonobos generally resumed social grooming with the same partner within one minute of an interruption, usually near the original grooming spot. Groomers frequently took up where they had left off on a partner’s body. And bonobos more often vocalized, gestured or otherwise communicated when restarting social grooming if they had been the one responsible for initiating the session or interrupting it for a food reward. That was especially true of higher-ranking bonobos in the community, suggesting some awareness of having broken a joint commitment and wanting to signal friendly intent when rejoining lower-ranking grooming partners, the scientists say. Still, it’s likely that bonobos think in less complex ways than people do about mutual commitments, Heesen and colleagues say. In previous studies, even 3-year-old children were much less willing to interrupt joint tasks for rewards than bonobos were in the new experiments.
Enormous X-ray bubbles balloon from the center of the Milky Way | Two giant, mysterious bubbles spew from the Milky Way’s heart, and now it appears the bubbles may have doubles. Scientists have known for a decade that two bubbles of charged particles, or plasma, flank the plane of the Milky Way. Those structures, known as the Fermi bubbles after the telescope that detected them, are visible in high-energy light called gamma rays (SN: 11/9/10). But now, the eROSITA X-ray telescope has revealed larger bubbles, seen in X-rays. The X-ray bubbles extend about 45,000 light-years above and below the center of the galaxy, researchers report online December 9 in Nature. Previously, researchers had seen an X-ray arc above the galactic plane (SN: 7/8/20). But no such feature was evident below the plane of the galaxy. That lack of symmetry led some scientists to discount the possibility of X-ray bubbles. With the new results, “this argument now has fallen,” says study coauthor Andrea Merloni, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany. The eROSITA data reveal a faint and previously unknown bubble below the galactic plane, and a matching bubble above. The gamma-ray bubbles are nested inside the X-ray bubbles, suggesting that the two features are connected, says Merloni. Studying the bubbles could help reveal violent events that may have taken place in the galaxy’s past. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is currently fairly quiet, as far as black holes go. But a past feeding frenzy might have spewed its leftovers outward, forming the structures. Or the bubbles could have been the result of a period when many stars formed and exploded in the galaxy’s heart. Further study of the X-ray and gamma-ray bubbles could help reveal the cause.
Drones could help create a quantum internet | The quantum internet may be coming to you via drone. Scientists have now used drones to transmit particles of light, or photons, that share the quantum linkage called entanglement. The photons were sent to two locations a kilometer apart, researchers from Nanjing University in China report in a study to appear in Physical Review Letters. Entangled quantum particles can retain their interconnected properties even when separated by long distances. Such counterintuitive behavior can be harnessed to allow new types of communication. Eventually, scientists aim to build a global quantum internet that relies on transmitting quantum particles to enable ultrasecure communications by using the particles to create secret codes to encrypt messages. A quantum internet could also allow distant quantum computers to work together, or perform experiments that test the limits of quantum physics. Quantum networks made with fiber-optic cables are already beginning to be used. And a quantum satellite can transmit photons across China . Drones could serve as another technology for such networks, with the advantages of being easily movable as well as relatively quick and cheap to deploy. The researchers used two drones to transmit the photons. One drone created pairs of entangled particles, sending one particle to a station on the ground while relaying the other to the second drone. That machine then transmitted the particle it received to a second ground station a kilometer away from the first. In the future, fleets of drones could work together to send entangled particles to recipients in a variety of locations.
Could delaying a second vaccine dose lead to more dangerous coronavirus strains? | Spiking COVID-19 cases, slow vaccine rollout and the emergence of more transmissible coronavirus variants in some countries have sparked debate among scientists over the best way to protect people with recently authorized vaccines.  One idea involves delaying when people receive the second of two required vaccine doses, so that more people can receive the doses that are currently available.  That’s happening in the United Kingdom, where researchers have raised concerns about a new coronavirus variant that appears to be more contagious than other versions. Officials there are opting to extend the time between each vaccine dose from three or four weeks to up to three months. In the United States, on the other hand, officials strongly recommend that states stick to the regimen that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized in December — two shots spaced three weeks apart for Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine and four weeks apart for Moderna’s.  On January 12, the Trump administration announced it was no longer holding back second shots of COVID-19 vaccines, several days after President-elect Joe Biden suggested he would release all the shots. While that may speed protection for more Americans, it also raises the possibility that people might not get their second doses on time, if manufacturing problems arise.   The possibility that second doses could be delayed has some experts concerned because it might lead to millions of people walking around with only partial immunity to the coronavirus, a condition that could be ripe for harmful mutations of the virus to arise. Delaying the second shot is a gamble, says Ramón Lorenzo-Redondo, a virologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, particularly without a lot of evidence suggesting how well one dose works. Officials “shouldn’t gamble [their] best tools” to fight the pandemic, he says. “We don’t want to fuel [potential viral evolution] by doing suboptimal immunization of the population.” How that fueling of virus evolution could happen comes down to the immune system. If people have full immunity as a result of vaccination, their immune response is likely to be robust, spawning large numbers of neutralizing antibodies, for example, that stop viruses from getting into cells and heading off harmful mutations before they arise. But if people have partial immunity, that immune response is likely to be weaker. It’s like when doctors encourage patients to finish a full course of antibiotics, Lorenzo-Redondo says. In that case, eliminating susceptible bacteria with a full course could help lower the chance that stragglers build up resistance.For the COVID-19 vaccine, if people’s second doses are delayed long enough — akin to not finishing a full complement of antibiotics — it’s possible that low numbers of neutralizing antibodies triggered by only one dose may only partially fight an infection. That might provide more time for variants of the virus with immune-dodging mutations to arise and thrive and be transmitted to other people.If immune-dodging variants do arise as a result of shot delays and spread to lots of people, that could deal a blow to vaccines’ effectiveness. For example, if mutations arose that prevented vaccine-induced antibodies from binding to the virus, or caused antibodies to bind less tightly, that virus variant may be more likely to infect cells than variants without the mutation and thus cause disease, Lorenzo-Redondo says. With cases surging in many places, including the United Kingdom and the United States, the coronavirus could have even more chances to accumulate vaccine-evading mutations than it would if case numbers were lower. For now, it’s unclear how protected vaccinated people are after a single shot and for how long. Trial participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine had low levels of neutralizing antibodies 21 days after the first dose, researchers reported in the Dec. 17 New England Journal of Medicine. But clinical trial results from both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines suggest that protection begins around two weeks after the first dose — Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine had an efficacy of around 50 percent after the first dose and Moderna’s had around 80 percent efficacy. It’s unknown how durable that protection might be, says Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, but it would be weird to see it fade quickly. Cobey is one of the scientists who isn’t worried about the risk of a long delay between shots.  Instead, expanding how many people get the first dose could actually help control how much the coronavirus changes, she says. That’s because even the partial protection that people may get from a single dose “will almost certainly lower the prevalence of infection,” she says. Fewer infections overall would mean fewer coronavirus variants in general circulating among people. By virtue of numbers, the coronavirus then may not accumulate as many mutations that could help it evade immune systems. And even if a virus accumulates mutations that help it dodge the immune response as a result of the dose delay, such changes might in turn damage essential viral functions like breaking into and hijacking a host cell. A virus that can escape immunity, for instance, might end up being less transmissible. For now, it’s unclear what might happen with the coronavirus, which in general mutates more slowly than other similar viruses thanks to a unique proofreading enzyme that acts as a spell-check for the letters that make up the coronavirus’s genetic blueprint. What’s more, the immune responses that a person makes also don’t attack just one part of a virus. Antibodies, for instance, including those induced by vaccines, hit many different parts of viral proteins, making it harder for the virus to escape. And over time antibodies can get better at their job. So, most mutations are unlikely to render antibodies completely ineffective.  “You put that all together and it’s a pretty high barrier” for virus evolution to work around, says Adam Lauring, an infectious disease physician and virologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.  In lab experiments, for example, COVID-19 patient serum that harbors myriad coronavirus antibodies still stops the coronavirus from infecting cells in a dish, even if there are viral mutations, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted January 4 at bioRxiv.org. While a few mutations — including one present in a coronavirus variant now circulating in South Africa — made antibodies in the serum less effective at stopping viruses from infecting cells, the serum’s virus-halting activity didn’t outright disappear. Still, that doesn’t mean potentially risky viral evolution as a result of delaying doses is not going to happen. “I think this is something we need to study and we need to look at for sure,” Lauring says. For now, “I’m not sure we know enough that we can really confidently say what one or other [vaccine-dosing] strategy is going to do.” 
A newfound feathered dinosaur sported fuzz and weird rods on its shoulders | The fossil of a chicken-sized, meat eater from Brazil that had a mane of fluffy filaments and a pair of stiff, ribbon-like streamers emerging from both shoulders is the first dinosaur with feathers ever discovered in the Southern Hemisphere. Named Ubirajara jubatus, the plucky predator lived 110 million years ago and probably used its unusual shoulder feathers and mane for display purposes to attract mates and ward off rivals, an international team of researchers reports online December 13 in Cretaceous Research. The name Ubirajara means “lord of the spear”’ and comes from the local Tupi Indigenous language, while jubatus comes from the Latin for maned or crested.    Many dinosaurs from the supercontinent of Gondwana, which covered much of the southern half of the planet during the Cretaceous Period, were assumed to have had feathers, but it’s exciting to finally have direct evidence, says study coauthor David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England. “These [shoulder] structures are really elaborate; they made this animal look pretty spectacular, just as a bird of paradise looks spectacular [today],” he says. “When birds have these sorts of feathers, they do all sorts of posh dances and displays, so this dinosaur looks like it was a little show-off.” The dinosaur is also interesting, because it is a member of the compsognathid group, which branched off from the family tree of carnivorous dinosaurs fairly early in the history of the group, Martill says. That suggests that the use of feathers for complex display purposes may have a very ancient history within the carnivorous dinosaurs.Max Langer, a paleontologist at the University of São Paulo who was not involved in the research, says it was only a matter of time until a feathered dinosaur was discovered in the Crato Formation in northeastern Brazil, where the fossil came from, or the surrounding rocks of the Araripe Plateau. Here, “the fossilization is pristine” with many specimens recording even details such as muscle fibers and blood vessels, he says.  A number of other dinosaurs without feathers have been found in the region. And a bird fossil with feathers, described in 2015, showed feather preservation in the rocks here was possible.  Langer adds that it’s a shame that an important fossil like this has ended up in Germany, rather than remaining in Brazil, and that Brazilian scientists were not involved in this research. “The fossils found here are part of the Brazilian paleontological heritage, so it is not good that this material is out of the country,” he argues. The fossil was probably found by local quarrymen who extract paving slabs from the fossil-bearing limestones of the Crato Formation, says study coauthor Eberhard Frey, a geoscientist at the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe in Germany. In the early 1990s, the fossil arrived at the paleontological museum in the city of Crato in Brazil’s Ceará state. Here, it came to the attention of Frey and Martill, who sought permission from local officials to export the fossil to Germany in 1995, where they have studied it in the intervening years, and where it remains today. 
Dog ticks may get more of a taste for human blood as the climate changes | Climate change could turn some dog ticks into suckers for humans instead of canines. At temperatures around 38° Celsius (100° Fahrenheit), some brown dog ticks were more attracted to people than to dogs, experiments show. The ticks can carry the pathogen that causes deadly Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The finding suggests that a warmer climate could lead to greater spread of the disease from ticks to humans, researchers reported November 16 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. “We can expect more frequent and larger disease outbreaks of Rocky Mountain spotted fever when hot weather occurs, and when we get hot weather more often,” says Laura Backus, a researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever can die if they don’t receive antibiotic treatment within five days. Around 5 to 10 percent of people infected succumb to the disease. Previous research in Europe had suggested that ticks are more aggressive toward people in hot weather. To find out whether brown dog ticks’ preference of host depends on temperature, Backus and her colleagues captured babies and adults of two genetically distinct groups, or lineages, of the species Rhipicephalus sanguineus. One lineage hailed from a hot region in Arizona, and was considered a tropical tick. The other lineage, from Oklahoma, tolerates colder weather and is considered temperate. The scientists compared the ticks’ behavior at a room temperature of 23° C (74° F) and at a sweltering 38° C. In 10 separate trials at each temperature, the scientists placed around 20 ticks from both lineages and age groups into the center of a plastic tube and gave them the option of moving toward a either a human or a dog. Normally, the tick prefers dogs to humans. But at the higher temperature, the adult tropical ticks showed a preference for the human. More than twice as many of the ticks moved toward the human at the hotter temperature compared with at room temperature. The temperature shift did not have a significant effect on the temperate ticks or the nymphs of either lineage. To test whether temperature affects whether brown dog ticks are more attracted to humans than dogs, researchers set up an experiment in which they placed a dog in one large wooden box (shown) and a person in another. They then connected the boxes with a clear plastic tube and watched to see whether ticks placed in the tube crawled toward the person or the dog. It is unclear why the adult tropical ticks switched their preference at high temperature. It may have something to do with the way they sense their hosts. “It is possible that their chemical receptors on their bodies are activated differently at high temperatures, but it’s still unclear,” Backus adds.  In the last two decades, the United States has seen a steady rise in tick-borne diseases. In 2000, there were 495 cases of spotted fever rickettsiosis, a category that includes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Now, 4,000 to 6,000 tickborne spotted fevers are reported in the United States each year. Different kinds of ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. But the brown dog tick is responsible for the spread in the southwestern United States. “The finding is very exciting, as it demonstrates the behavioral difference between the two lineages,” says Kathleen Walker, an entomologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not associated with the study. More tropical ticks, she adds, are moving to the north as temperatures rise due to global warming. Backus says that her team would like to study brown dog ticks from more regions in the future, a step toward having a bigger dataset to look for patterns. “And if they prefer humans at high temperatures, as this study finds, then that helps in understanding why we are seeing more Rocky Mountain spotted fever outbreaks,” she says.
Monarch caterpillars head-butt each other to fight for scarce food | When food and space get scarce, competition can bring out the worst in monarch caterpillars. In the laboratory, researchers watched as roaming caterpillars looking for a hard-to-find meal started head-butting and lunging at fellow caterpillars munching on a milkweed leaf. That aggressive behavior is apparently meant to disrupt the feeding insects and help the instigators score dinner, biologist and neuroscientist Alex Keene and colleagues report online November 19 in iScience. Keene usually studies fruit flies and cavefish, but he decided to adapt his laboratory to study monarchs after a chance observation. “My wife pointed out in the backyard that these two monarch caterpillars were fighting with each other,” says Keene, of Florida Atlantic University in Jupiter. “I went on YouTube, and there were videos of this behavior,” he says, but for monarchs, “it wasn’t documented anywhere in the scientific literature.” Other types of caterpillars have shown similar aggressive behavior in other settings. Going from a self-proclaimed “simple fly biologist” to monarch researcher, however, was a challenge. Not only did Hurricane Dorian in 2019 blow over the plants in the lab’s monarch garden, but also finding pesticide-free milkweed plants that the caterpillars would eat was harder than expected. Once the researchers overcame these challenges, though, they were able to film caterpillars competing with one another when the researchers limited the amount of available food.  “With decreasing food availability, we find increased levels of aggression,” as well as a “loser response,” with the caterpillar that gets attacked often leaving the area, says Elizabeth Brown, a biologist who works in Keene’s lab. This kind of behavior does occur outside the lab, says Jaap de Roode, a biologist at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn’t involved in the research. Competition can be tough, he adds, because monarch caterpillars are limited in their food options. The insects eat only milkweed, and are more or less stuck on the plant that they’re born on until they bulk up, because crawling from plant to plant takes energy. If there isn’t enough food from the one plant to feed several caterpillars, “they won’t make it,” he says. Making things more difficult, the caterpillars need a huge amount of food to transform into a butterfly. “From egg to chrysalis, they multiply their weight 3,000 times, and they do that in about two weeks,” de Roode says. That’s like a person gaining the weight of two blue whales in two weeks. “Monarchs are like eating machines,” Keene says. But “some were much more aggressive than others.” So the next step could be exploring whether or not the more aggressive caterpillars grow into aggressive butterflies, he says.
We still don’t know what COVID-19 immunity means or how long it lasts | Even as U.S. President Donald Trump claims his bout with COVID-19 has granted him immunity, reports of people getting the disease a second time are emerging. While reinfection still appears to be rare, it remains unclear to what extent immunity can truly protect a person.  Immunity is also in the news because a debate is simmering among scientists over herd immunity, the point at which enough people are immune to a pathogen to slow its spread. While herd immunity might put the end of the pandemic in sight, experts estimate that around 40 to 60 percent of a population would need to be infected to reach it.One group of researchers is pushing for governments to reach herd immunity without a vaccine, by allowing COVID-19 to spread among those at low risk while protecting vulnerable populations. This approach, however, puts the entire population at risk of significant illness and death, another group argues in a letter published October 14 in the Lancet. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, scientists can’t say how long a person will be protected after they’ve recovered from an infection. If immunity wanes quickly, that sets the stage for recurrent outbreaks unless there’s a vaccine, the authors say. Here’s what we know so far about our long-term defenses against the coronavirus:  What does “immunity” really mean? To scientists, immunity means a resistance to a disease gained through the immune system’s exposure to it, either by infection or through vaccination. But immunity doesn’t always mean complete protection from the virus.  How does the body build immunity? The immune system has two ways to provide lasting protection: T cells that remember the pathogen and trigger a rapid response, and B cells that produce antibodies — proteins the body makes to fight off a specific pathogen. Ideally, long after a person has recovered from an infection, these antibodies stick around in their blood. Then if the person is exposed to the same pathogen again in the future, those antibodies recognize the threat and work to prevent another infection from taking hold. So-called “memory T cells” also stick around. Ideally, they live up to their name and recognize a previously encountered pathogen and either help coordinate the immune system or kill infected cells.   With one type of immunity, called sterilizing immunity, the virus never gets a chance to begin replicating and never infects a cell. Sterilizing immunity, however, is hard to achieve. More often, people achieve partial immunity, which provides a rapid response that may make the second bout of the disease less severe, or less easily transmitted to others. It’s unclear what type of immunity people who have recovered from COVID-19 have, and only time will tell. A vaccine could possibly trigger a stronger immune response than a natural infection, although it’s yet to be seen if that will be the case for the coronavirus vaccines in trials.  If a person has antibodies, are they immune? For some illnesses, like measles, antibodies may last a lifetime. But for SARS-CoV-2, the jury is still out. It’s unknown how long antibodies last in the blood, or — importantly — whether their presence is a sign of immunity. Just because a person has antibodies, it doesn’t mean they are effective at fighting the virus. Neutralizing antibodies are ones that halt the virus in its tracks, stopping it from infecting a host cell and replicating. Such antibodies typically recognize the virus’ spike protein, which helps it break into host cells. So far, those kinds of antibodies have been a focus of studies seeking to understand whether a person may be immune. “For the majority of people, it does appear that they are generating neutralizing antibodies,” says Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “So that’s promising.” Yet it’s still unknown what amount of neutralizing antibody is sufficient for protection. And even if they are protective, it’s unclear how long these immune proteins stick around. Studies of recovered COVID-19 patients have shown that antibodies for the coronavirus can wane after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but overall, their levels remain relatively stable over a span of three to six months. Because the coronavirus only began its sweep around the world at the beginning of the year, “there’s just been a limited time for people to study this,” Gordon says. See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Some data suggest the immune system might not have a great memory for coronavirus infections. One study found that during a COVID-19 infection, the organ that produces memory B cells — long-lived cells that will rapidly produce antibodies if a person is re-exposed to a pathogen — doesn’t properly activate the cell types capable of becoming memory B cells. Without that immunological memory, antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 may not last very long, researchers report August 19 in Cell. “Maybe that means that those memory responses are going to be on the short side,” says Brianne Barker, an immunologist at Drew University in Madison, N.J. What do we know about T cells? Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients typically develop an immune response involving T cells. Even recovered patients without a detectable antibody response have T cells in their blood, researchers report October 15 in Emerging Infectious Diseases. But the role of T cells in infection and immune memory remains unclear. Studies have shown that memory T cells can persist in patients who were infected with the coronavirus responsible for the 2003–2004 SARS outbreak for up to 11 years after recovery. Since that virus no longer circulates, however, it’s impossible to say whether those T cells might be protective. Some people may already have T cells that can recognize pieces of the new coronavirus . Those immune cells may be left over from previous exposures to coronaviruses that cause the common cold, researchers report August 4 in Science. These cross-reactive T cells might help reduce the length or severity of COVID-19 illness. On the flip side, such T cells could make the disease worse, perhaps by overstimulating the immune system and causing a condition called cytokine storm, which is behind some severe COVID-19 cases. Can you get the coronavirus twice? Researchers have now documented a small number of cases where people have been infected with the coronavirus twice. The first such case was reported in Hong Kong, with additional reports the United States, the Netherlands and elsewhere. but it’s still unclear how common reinfections are. And with only a handful of cases so far, “we can’t really say that reinfections are telling us a whole lot at this point,” Barker says, either about immunity or whether vaccines will provide long-term protection or will need to become part of our yearly routine, like flu shots. Some reinfections are expected; some people’s immune memory may not be potent enough to prevent the infection entirely, though it may prevent them from getting sick. It’s hard to prove that someone has been reinfected, because researchers need to conclusively show that two different viruses caused each infection, Barker says. That requires genetic testing. What’s more, experts are not necessarily on the lookout for such cases, especially in people who are not displaying symptoms. What does all of this mean for herd immunity? Without knowing how long immunity lasts after an infection, and how much that varies from person to person, it’s impossible to know whether ending the pandemic through herd immunity is even possible. What is clear, experts say, is that attempting to reach herd immunity without a vaccine will lead to more illness and death. “Promoting the concept of ‘herd immunity’ … as an answer to the COVID-19 pandemic is inappropriate, irresponsible and ill-informed,” Thomas File Jr., president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Judith Feinberg, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, said in a statement October 14. And to date, herd immunity is still far off. “Throughout the United States, we are nowhere near herd immunity,” Gordon says. “Taking the approach of herd immunity through natural infection will lead to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.” 
Mice may ‘catch’ each other’s pain — and pain relief | In pain and pain relief, mice may feel for each other. Research has shown that mice can “catch” the emotions of an injured or fearful fellow. When some mice are injured, other healthy mice living alongside them behave as though in pain. Now, a study suggests that not only can pain be passed along, but also pain relief is contagious too.In the last decade, researchers have done a lot of work showing that animals can pick up and share each other’s emotions, particularly fear , says Monique Smith, a neuroscientist at Stanford University. She and colleagues published their new findings on pain and relief in the Jan. 8 Science. Investigating these building blocks of empathy in animals can help researchers understand human empathy, Smith says, and may someday lead to treatments for disorders that affect the ability to be sensitive to the feelings and experiences of other people. Pain isn’t just a physical experience,” Smith says. “It’s an emotional experience” as well. In experiments on pairs of mice, one mouse received an injection that caused arthritis-like inflammation in one hind paw while the other mouse was unharmed. After hanging out together for an hour, “the bystander has it worse than the mouse that got the injection,” says Jeffrey Mogil, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal who was not part of the work. Injected mice acted as though one paw is in pain, as expected, showing extra sensitivity to being prodded there with a plastic wire. Their uninjured companions also showed heightened sensitivity, and in both hind paws. Those mice act as though they’re in the same amount of pain and in more places, Mogil says. “The behavior is astounding.” In another set of experiments, both mice received the irritating injection, but one also got a dose of soothing morphine. For hours after these mice mingled, the second mouse behaved as though it also got the drug. “You’ve actually relieved pain in this animal simply by letting it hang out with another animal whose pain was relieved,” says Robert Malenka, a neuroscientist also at Stanford University. In a control group where both mice partners experienced inflammation, the animals’ sensitivity didn’t change after their time together. To understand how these mice pick up on each other’s feelings, Smith, Malenka and their colleague neuroscientist Naoyuki Asada watched which brain regions were active after the mice spent time together. The team saw nerve cells, or neurons, firing in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area important in human empathy and part of the brain region responsible for memory and cognition. The team found neurons connecting this area to other parts of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens, an area that deals with motivation and social behavior. When the scientists disrupted that particular neural connection, “the animals no longer were able to manifest empathy” for pain or pain relief, Malenka says. The transfer of other emotions between mice may rely on different brain connections. The researchers also examined how mice feel each other’s fear in experiments where mice saw other mice receive an electric shock. The team found that fear transfer relied on connections from the cortex to part of the amygdala, a region known to respond to fear. That suggests that different processes in the brain are involved in different types of empathy. But the differences may also be linked to how mice sense their fellows’ emotions, Mogil says. In the pain and pain relief experiments, mice spend time together sniffing each other, and odors can contain clues to the animals’ feelings. But in the tests on fear, visual cues conveyed animal emotions.  “Not surprisingly, the circuits that they’re looking at are remarkably similar to some of these processes in humans,” says Jules Panksepp, a social neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not part of the study. Both mice and humans share a connectedness with their compatriots in emotional situations, he says, and research points to a shared evolutionary basis for empathy. If scientists can home in on the neurochemicals that foster empathic processes, Panksepp says, they may be able to design drugs to treat conditions, such as psychopathy or social personality disorders, that cause empathy to go awry.
Supercooled water has been caught morphing between two forms | Supercooled water is two of a kind, a new study shows. Scientists have long suspected that water at subfreezing temperatures comes in two distinct varieties: a high-density liquid that appears at very high pressures and a low-density liquid at lower pressures. Now, ultrafast measurements have caught water morphing from one type of liquid to the other, confirming that hunch. The discovery, reported in the Nov. 20 Science, could help explain some of water’s quirks.The experiment “adds more and more evidence to the idea that water really is two components … and that that is the reason that underlies why water is so weird,” says physicist Greg Kimmel of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., who was not involved in the study.When free from impurities, water can remain liquid below its typical freezing point of zero degrees Celsius, forming what’s called a supercooled liquid. But the dual nature of supercooled water was expected to appear in a temperature realm so difficult to study that it’s been dubbed “no-man’s-land.” Below around –40° C, water remains liquid for mere instants before it crystallizes into ice. Making the task even more daunting, the high-density phase appears only at very high pressures. Still, “people have dreamt about how to do an experiment,” says Anders Nilsson of Stockholm University.Thanks to speedy experimental maneuvers, Nilsson and colleagues have infiltrated that no-man’s-land by monitoring water’s properties on a scale of nanoseconds. “This is one of the major accomplishments of this paper,” says computational chemist Gül Zerze of Princeton University. “I’m impressed with their work.”The scientists started by creating a type of high-density ice. Then, a pulse from an infrared laser heated the ice, forming liquid water under high pressure. That water then expanded, and the pressure rapidly dropped. Meanwhile, the researchers used an X-ray laser to investigate how the structure of the water changed, based on how the X-rays scattered. As the pressure decreased, the water transitioned from a high-density to low-density fluid before crystallizing into ice.Previous studies have used ultrafast techniques to find hints of water’s two-faced demeanor, but those have been done mainly at atmospheric pressure. In the new work, the water was observed at about 3,000 times atmospheric pressure and –68° C. “It’s the first time we have real experimental data at these pressures and temperatures,” says physicist Loni Kringle of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, who was not involved with the experiment.The result could indicate that supercooled water has a “critical point” — a certain pressure and temperature at which two distinct phases merge into one. In the future, Nilsson hopes to pinpoint that spot.Such a critical point could explain why water is an oddball liquid. For most liquids, cooling makes them become denser and more difficult to compress. Water gets denser as it is cooled to 4° C, but becomes less dense as it is cooled further. Likewise, its compressibility increases as it’s cooled.If supercooled water has a critical point, that could indicate that the water experienced in daily life is strange because, under typical pressures and temperatures, it is a supercritical liquid — a weird state that occurs beyond a critical point. Such a liquid would not be the high-density or low-density form, but would consist of some regions with a high-density arrangement of water molecules and other pockets of low density. The relative amounts of those two structures, which result from different arrangements of hydrogen bonds between the molecules, would change as the temperature changes, explaining why water behaves strangely as it is cooled. So despite the fact that the experiment involved extreme pressures and temperatures, Nilsson says, “it influences water in our ordinary life.”
Severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare, CDC says | Out of the first 1.9 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine administered in the United States, there were 21 reported cases of severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said January 6.The rate of anaphylaxis seen so far — 11.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses — is higher than for the flu vaccine, which is 1.3 cases per 1 million doses, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Jan. 6 news briefing. But the reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are “still exceedingly rare,” she said. “These are safe and effective vaccines. We have good data to show that,” Messonnier said. The country’s surveillance systems for vaccine side effects are “incredibly robust,” she said, and “the only thing that we have seen is these severe allergic reactions.” Still, sites that administer COVID-19 vaccines need to be able to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis — which, if it occurs, would most likely happen shortly after vaccination — and be prepared to treat it, CDC officials said. And people who have a history of anaphylaxis as a result of any cause should be observed for 30 minutes after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening, requires emergency treatment with epinephrine. The United Kingdom, which began immunizing its population against COVID-19 with the Pfizer vaccine December 8, was the first country to report cases of the severe allergic reaction following vaccinations . The CDC reported on the 21 cases in the United States, which cover vaccinations given from December 14 to 23, in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report study published online January 6. These first vaccinations were only with Pfizer’s vaccine. Officials don’t yet know what is causing the allergic reaction after immunization with the vaccine. There were no deaths from anaphylaxis reported in the study. Nineteen of the 21 people were treated with epinephrine and four were hospitalized. Seven of the people in the report had experienced anaphylaxis in the past. CDC officials recommend that people with a history of anaphylaxis alert the person administering the shot before getting it. The CDC is continuing to monitor for these reactions. Since the report’s data were analyzed, the total number of reported reactions in the United States has grown slightly to 29 cases, the agency said at the news briefing. Some of those new cases were tied to vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
Senate Republicans ponder barring Donald Trump from seeking office again | An impeachment trial of Donald Trump isn't about removing him from the presidency – his term ends Wednesday, either way. It's about preventing him from seeking the presidency again in 2024. Several senators, including Republicans, have noted that if they vote to convict Trump of inciting last week's attack on Congress, they could then vote to bar him from future public office, effectively nixing another presidential campaign. "If the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again," said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., soon to be the new Senate Majority Leader. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the chamber's top Republican, made clear he is considering conviction, opening the door to an effective ban on Trump within the Republican Party. "I have not made a final decision on how I will vote," McConnell said this week. "and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.” To be sure, conviction is not guaranteed; House prosecutors would need at least 17 Republican senators to join all Democrats in support of it. But many Republicans beyond Congress have said it would be a good idea to leave Trump behind, underscoring GOP anxiety over another Trump presidential run in the wake of last week's insurrection by supporters. Another Trump candidacy would further divide and undermine the Republican Party, making it more vulnerable in future congressional and presidential races, several Republicans have said. Many blame Trump for this month's losses by two Republican senators in Georgia, defeats that cost the party control of the chamber. Also, some said, Trump did incite riots designed to threaten lawmakers into reversing the results of his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden. "Republican senators need to protect the republic, public safety, and themselves – both politically and their actual lives, which were seriously threatened thanks to Trump’s behavior," said Republican strategist Liz Mair. Trump supporters said they do not fear excommunication, and Republicans who support it will only be hurting themselves. They said Trump retains immense Republican support, and would take millions of voters with him if he is run out of the party. "He's the leader of the Republican Party – end of story," said Trump political adviser Jason Miller. Banning Trump from running again would be popular with most Americans, but deeply unpopular with those who consider themselves Republicans, according to post-insurrection public opinion polls. A majority (56%) of Americans overall believe the Senate should remove Trump from office and disqualify him from running again, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday. Only 12% of Republicans support such a move, the poll said, and those are the people who decide party primaries. Trump's approval numbers do appear to be dropping fast, however. A Pew Research Center poll shows Trump's approval rating down to 29% – and at 60% among Republicans who once favored him by more than 90%. Trump has not decided whether to run again, and his decision will signal the start of a new presidential election cycle for the Republicans. For weeks after Election Day on Nov. 3, Trump signaled his plans to run again in 2024, telling a crowd of followers at a White House holiday party, "I’ll see you in four years." Allies talked about an announcement and campaign rally on or near the Jan. 20 date for Biden's inauguration. That talk ended with the insurrection of Jan. 6. Even if he announces he isn't running for president, Trump is still planning to get involved in the 2022 congressional elections – targeting Republicans who displeased him during the election protest. The outgoing president has threatened to campaign against Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga. and Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., two Republicans who objected to Trump demands that Biden electoral votes be voided. Trump allies are also targeting the ten House Republicans who voted in favor of impeachment. Trump would face obstacles to another presidential run beyond impeachment. He could face lawsuits over the insurrection and other legal action. Prosecutors in New York are investigating Trump over his private financial dealings. Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor who specializes in the history of the presidency, said the Senate has the authority to try ex-officials for offenses committed while in office. The Senate also has the right to approve “disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States," Kalt said, quoting the U.S. Constitution. If it came to that, he added, Trump could contest the verdict in court: "There is some debate as to whether the disqualification clause covers the presidency, or instead only covers appointed office." In one important way, disqualification would be the easier vote. Conviction of Trump requires a two-thirds majority, 67 of 100 senators; a vote to bar him from future office requires only a simple majority, 51 of 100. The Senate will soon be split 50-50 between the parties, and a few Republicans have suggested they want to purge Trump from the party. Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said members of the party like McConnell know "Trump and his insurrectionist brand of politics is destroying the Republican Party and is dangerous for the country." She added that "responsible conservatives know that this cancerous tumor will not disappear on its own; it needs to excised, so that the body politic may heal." Alex Conant, a Republican political consultant who worked for Marco Rubio's presidential campaign in 2016, said the Republicans won't be a majority party as long as Trump is a major part of it. "This entire episode is a complete disaster for the Republican Party," Conant said. "Republicans are left with no good options; there are merely less bad ones."
White man who stabbed Black college student to death in Maryland sentenced to life in prison | A white man was sentenced to life in prison Thursday for fatally stabbing a Black college student in what prosecutors described as a racially motivated hate crime on the University of Maryland’s main campus in 2017. A jury convicted Sean Urbanski, 25, of first-degree murder for the death of Richard Collins III, a newly commissioned Army lieutenant, in December 2019. On the night of his murder, Collins was days away from graduating from Bowie State University, a historically Black college, and was celebrating with a friend at bars. His mother, Dawn Collins said "he was on a pinnacle of doing great things,” at a press conference Thursday. “He had aspired to be the next Gen. Colin Powell,” Collins said. “And there was nothing that was going to stop him.” Urbanski, who was enrolled at the University of Maryland’s College Park campus, was also drinking with friends at bars that night. Early in the morning on May 20, 2017, Urbanski approached Collins at a bus stop where he was waiting with two people, a white man and an Asian woman. Urbanski brandished a knife. “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” Urbanski told them, according to police. Collins said no and Urbanski stabbed him once in his chest. He then sat down on a bench until police arrived and arrested him. Prosecutors said alcohol and racist propaganda emboldened Urbanksi to act on his hatred of Black people. Urbanksi was part of several alt-right Facebook groups that shared racist images, according to Prince George’s County state’s attorney, Aisha Braveboy. At a press conference after the sentencing, Braveboy said the hate that drove Urbanksi to murder was the same hate that fueled the riot at the US Capitol on Jan. 6. "It cannot and will not be tolerated," she said. "Hate kills and it killed this young man." Defense attorneys argued there was no evidence of a racial motive for the killing. Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Hill Jr. dismissed a hate crime charge against Urbanski saying that prosecutors didn’t meet their legal burden of showing that racial hatred motivated Urbanski to stab Collins. But the judge said Thursday that he believes race and alcohol both were factors in the killing Collins' parents have successfully lobbied to enact legislation named after their son which changed the state's hate crime law. Prosecutors now don't have to prove hate is the only motivating factor in committing a crime. lthough prosecutors had sought the maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, Urbanksi will be eligible for parole, Braveboy said. Dawn and Richard Collins Jr. expressed disappointment that Urbanski didn't receive the maximum sentence Thursday. Urbanski apologized to Collins' parents during the hearing for the “horrible pain” he caused them and said he wishes he could “go back and change what happened." “There hasn’t been a day that’s gone by where I haven’t thought about what I’ve done to you, and if I could switch places with your son I would in a heartbeat,” Urbanski said.
Staying Apart, Together: We're emotionally exhausted. But we can get through it. | Well, last week was both a good and bad week to take a "vacation." While spending some time off at home (mostly playing board games, watching "Frasier" and cuddling with Apollo), I got the news about the riot at the U.S. Capitol through breaking news alerts, on TV and in text messages from friends and family. Since I wasn't working, I wasn't consumed with newsroom chats, editorial tasks and writing like I often am during tragic and scary events.  Turns out, I rely on that distraction as a coping skill far more than I realized. Without a long to do list and the buzz of work to keep my mind busy, I had to use other coping strategies to get through the week. I leaned on my support system. I exercised. I let my husband take my phone so I'd stop doom-scrolling. And it helped. Even just a little bit.  It's hard, we're more exhausted than we know (more on that below) and it's a tough and scary time. I hope this newsletter can offer some distraction and some help this week. There is a term for what a lot of us are feeling right now. My colleague Alia Dagastir, wrote about "emotional exhaustion," the feeling many of us have right now. Our tanks are empty, as she put it. "Emotional exhaustion is this sense of overwhelmingness. Overwhelmed to the point where you feel like you don't have the capacity to deal anymore," said Vaile Wright, senior director of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association. "It's physical tiredness. It's mental tiredness. It's difficulty concentrating. It's all the things that we experience when we're just at our capacity." And yet, most of us don't have the luxury of stepping away from our responsibilities, especially now. In this era of uncertainty, we can't eliminate some of our biggest stressors nor can we predict which one is coming next. Here are some tips from mental health experts about dealing with this extreme exhaustion.  Set boundaries. "If you've been supporting a friend or family member, maybe it's our turn to say, 'Hey, I don't have the bandwidth to be your emotional support right now. I care for you. I love you. But I really got to hang up the phone and take care of me for a moment,'" said Lynn Bufka, associate executive director for practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association. Don't try to be a superhero. If you're stretched too thin, experts say, ask yourself “What am I taking on that is optional or that I can pull back from?” If your standard has always been a from-scratch meal, maybe consider frozen or canned vegetables instead.  Think about what refills you emotionally. When you're emotionally depleted, reach for things that make you feel good. Ask yourself: What kind of music nourishes me? Which friend makes me laugh?

Jacob Blake speaks on police shooting that left him paralyzed: 'I didn’t want to be the next George Floyd' |  Jacob Blake regrets picking up the knife that he says fell out of his pocket during a struggle with a Kenosha police officer on Aug. 23.  “I shouldn’t have picked it up, only, considering what was going on,” Blake said in an interview with ABC's Michael Strahan, which aired on "Good Morning America" Thursday. “At the time I wasn’t thinking clearly.” Blake was shot seven times by Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey Aug. 23. He recalled telling his children, “Daddy loves you, no matter what.”   “I thought it was going to be the last thing I said to them. Thank God it wasn’t,” said Blake, who is now paralyzed from the waist down.  “I didn’t want to be the next George Floyd,” Blake told Strahan, an NFL Hall of Famer. “I didn’t want to die.”   On Jan. 5, Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley decided not to charge any officers involved in the Blake shooting. He also is not charging Blake with any crimes related to the incident.   The shooting of Blake was caught on video, which went viral, causing days of unrest and protests in Kenosha.   In the moments before the shooting, Blake said there was an argument between his girlfriend and a neighbor and he was putting the kids in the car to take them to the store in hopes of making them forget about all the arguing. At the time, there was an open felony warrant for Blake’s arrest in a past incident of domestic violence, Graveley said. Blake’s girlfriend had allowed him to come to their son’s birthday party even though he wasn’t supposed to be at her house, she said on a 911 call played at the Jan. 5 news conference. When police arrived, struggle ensued.  In the interview, Blake recalled several of the details that were included in the 800-page report from Graveley.  Graveley said that Blake pulled a knife from his waistband and that when officers tased Blake, he pulled out the prongs. However, in the interview, Blake claims when he was tased he fell on top of Sheskey. He then pulled the prongs out and got off Sheskey. That’s when he says his knife fell out of his pocket and he picked it up.  Blake told Strahan he planned to put the knife in the car and “throw myself to the ground and, you know, put my arms behind my back. Because if they did it there, and they killed me there, everyone would see it.”  According to Sheskey, he said Blake tried to drive the knife toward his body. Blake denies doing that.   Blake said he couldn’t hear officers' commands as he was walking away.  “All I could hear is screaming, screaming, my ears were ringing,” Blake said. “It was all muffled.”   Since being shot, Blake has had 37 surgeries and attends physical therapy four times a week.   Blake said he talked to his children about what happened, telling them, “Daddy can die, but for some reason, I didn’t that day.” 
Screens in cars are getting even bigger? Is it safe? | Screens in vehicles are getting bigger and bigger. But is that better? German automaker Daimler's Mercedes-Benz revealed a new 56-inch screen nearly spanning the width of an entire car earlier this month, becoming the latest brand to bet on larger-than-ever digital displays. The Jan. 7 announcement came as other car brands like Tesla, Ram and Toyota turn the dashboards and instrument panels of certain new vehicles into a sort of Apple store. Gone are the days of playing-card-sized screens causing drivers and passengers to squint their eyes at low-resolution text and poorly designed graphics. Welcome to the era where the screen is king, and analog buttons are facing the guillotine.  "It seems like screens in cars are taking after screens in homes," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at car-research site Edmunds. "We never thought screens would get this large." But safety watchdogs have raised concerns that bigger screens can distract drivers, especially if they're hard to use. “There are already some studies that indicate significant driver distraction can be a result of in-dashboard screens," Jason K. Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said in an email. "The question is, by making them bigger, wider and more integrated with the vehicle, does this make an existing problem worse?" For example, a 2019 study by AAA found that the design of in-vehicle infotainment technology's voice commands, software menus and center consoles was often distracting – and especially so for older drivers. The federal government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicles, has raised a red flag about driver distraction, but has not rolled out federal standards to limit it, Levine noted. "Which means there’s always likely to be at least one manufacturer who will be willing to push the limits to get that 'wow' factor," Levine said. Automotive industry experts largely agree that Tesla kick-started the trend of large tablet-style infotainment screens in vehicles with the Model S ultra-luxury sedan. It continued the strategy with its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, replacing most conventional buttons with a digital display that can be updated via over-the-air software updates. In the years since, other automakers have begun embracing screens, as well.  When it rolled out the redesigned Ram pickup in 2019, Fiat Chrysler equipped the vehicle with a 12-inch touchscreen, which is about the size of a laptop. When it debuted the Toyota Prius Prime in 2017, Toyota began offering a nearly 12-inch screen on upgraded models.  But it's Tesla that's still widely identified with big screens, for better or worse. When engineers recently released a software update, some Tesla owners complained that buttons were confusingly rearranged. "Definitely a distracting downgrade - wish I could go back," one user posted on a Tesla forum message thread titled, "New Display Layout is Horrendous." Tesla did not respond to a request seeking comment. Displays on doors? Automakers are expanding screen size in large part because customers want to mirror their consumer electronics experience in the vehicle, said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at research firm IHS Markit. "People like them basically," she said. For an automaker like Mercedes-Benz, a bigger and better screen might be the most efficient way to grab the attention of potential buyers who have a bevy of other attractive options. "It’s just not enough to offer cool features anymore because you can get a touchscreen and heated seats in an inexpensive Kia," said Brian Moody, executive editor of car-buying site Autotrader. "So what's pushing this (trend) is there has to be serious and identifiable differentiators." Moody predicted that automakers will go further, perhaps even by incorporating screens on the sides of new vehicles. "Imagine having art or video screens on the door panels," he said. "All those things I think are yet to come." Automakers are increasingly embracing screens in part because it allows them to update their vehicles over time, something that Tesla essentially pioneered. "As automakers get over-the-air updates even quicker, you have the opportunity to make changes to what that (screen) looks like over the life of the vehicle," Brinley said.
Student loan forgiveness: Biden to continue freeze of payments, ask Congress to erase debt |  President-elect Joe Biden's administration plans to continue a pause on federal student loan payments when he takes office this month, according to officials helping with the transition. The nation’s tens of millions of student loan borrowers could continue to abstain from making payments, though it wasn't immediately clear how long the pause would last.   Biden officials also said Friday they would encourage Congress to pass legislation to erase $10,000 in federal student loan debt per person. That move, however, is likely to draw criticism from activists who have pushed Biden to forgive more debt per person, in some cases up to $50,000, via executive action upon taking office. In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump's administration suspended student loan payments, froze interest and told loan servicers to stop their collection efforts. That pause recently was extended by outgoing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos through the end of January.  "On day one, the President-elect will direct the Department of Education to extend the existing pause on student loan payments and interest for millions of Americans with federal student loans," said David Kamin, the incoming deputy director of the National Economic Council and recently a professor at New York University's law school. Wiping out federal student loan debt is more controversial. Critics of student loan forgiveness, who include both liberals and conservatives, have said wiping out these debts would unfairly benefit those with a college education, who typically earn more as a result. According to Federal Reserve data, Americans hold about $1.7 trillion in student loan debt. Student borrowers who graduated in 2019 from public or private nonprofit colleges held on average $28,950 in debt, according to The Institute for College Access and Success.
When teachers brought free lunch to kids amid COVID-19, they saw poverty up close | First-grade teacher Shiela Garland had long known that 100% of students in Arizona’s Stanfield Elementary School District, where she has taught for 16 years, ate free meals.Garland did not really know what those numbers meant until this spring, when the coronavirus pandemic hit and schools closed across the United States. Suddenly, she and other Stanfield staff found themselves in masks and gloves, riding up to 150 miles a day on school buses traversing gravel and dirt roads to hand out food and homework packets to children.Before the pandemic, Garland usually saw her students only in the classroom. Some students’ homes she visited lacked electricity, indoor plumbing or windows, she said. “Going out there and actually pulling up in front of the houses, you know, to deliver the food and stuff and seeing the situation these kids are living in – it breaks your heart,” Garland said. Halfway across the country, school staff in rural Cobden, Illinois, also were discovering the meaning of poverty firsthand. The district covers about 88 square miles of a community where agriculture is one of the main industries.“A lot of our staff lives outside of the community and don't drive the back roads. You really don't pay attention to those places until you're walking up,” said Cobden Superintendent Edwin Shoemate. Shoemate tells a story about how, early in the pandemic, he and the staff learned that a mother and son were living in an approximately 10-foot-by-10-foot house and got their water from a hose outside. Families like this motivated Shoemate and his staff as they delivered meals each weekday morning during the school year. Statistics about poverty and hunger in rural America have been available for years, and many rural schools have taken steps to combat hunger with government and locally run programs.But some teachers say those statistics have taken on new meaning since the pandemic began. In some rural school districts where teachers and administrators volunteered to deliver food to needy families amid the coronavirus outbreak, some educators say they encountered poverty firsthand for the first time, gaining new insight into the everyday challenges and academic barriers facing their students. It's the first thing that most superintendents at small rural districts wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning and think about: ‘How am I going to get these kids fed today?’” said David Ardrey, executive director of the Association of Illinois Rural and Small Schools. With many rural schools again meeting in person, schools are taking what they learned over the summer and turning those lessons into action – whether that action is smoother food deliveries or making sure students’ most basic needs are filled.The experience in the spring also has prepared teachers for more possible school closures as coronavirus cases surge across the country. Meeting the needs of children has been difficult during the pandemic. Food insecurity is a big reason why.As the pandemic hit, more than 17% of mothers said their children were not getting enough to eat and they didn’t have enough money to buy more food, according to a national survey by the Brookings Institution in April. Compared with a similar question asked in a Department of Agriculture survey, that figure has increased 460% since 2018, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at Brookings.During the initial months of the pandemic, the federal government paid for grocery purchases for some families with children who eat free at school, so they didn’t have to go to school pick-up sites to get meals.In the fall, the special grocery program was extended through September 2021 for children whose school buildings are closed. The coronavirus relief package that passed Congress last month further expanded the program to include all children under age 6, along with emergency money for schools and day care centers that feed students.“Given the circumstances and the scale of the need, this is a problem that schools can't solve,” Bauer said. But districts tried when schools closed this spring.Shoemate, the Cobden superintendent, is no stranger to the stress of feeding students. Still, the school’s teachers couldn’t always relate to what students were going through at home. Before the pandemic, 65% of the district’s approximately 530 students qualified for free or reduced-price meals. A third of the district’s students are Hispanic and two-thirds are white; 93% of their teachers are white and only 4.5% are Hispanic, according to state data.After school closed this spring to in-house instruction, the Cobden community stepped up to help deliver meals, buy groceries and donate gift cards as the needs of area families grew, Shoemate said. “It's all these resources and trying to use them wisely, and trying to make sure that you're taking care of everybody that needs it – knowing in the back of your mind that you're not doing enough for some kids,” Shoemate said.Cobden parent Jeannie Gerlach, a bookkeeper at a medical clinic, lives on a tight budget. Because her two kids ate meals at school when class is in session, she did not have money budgeted for extra meals once school went online. Having teachers drop off meals gave her family a boost.“Those meals mean a lot,” Gerlach said. “It's more than just the food that they provide. It gives a little bit more normalcy because it's a staff that's bringing them.” One of those staff members was school counselor April Reiman.Reiman volunteered, in part, to get an idea of what types of obstacles children in the community were experiencing. She came to the district in 2017.   Reiman felt it took her about a year to really get to know the community and its residents. She and her family do not live in Cobden, in part because of her husband’s long commute to work. Her own commute is 25 minutes one-way.She described Cobden as a small community that prioritizes its school and students. “I thought I had a pretty good handle until I rode the buses,” Reiman said. “It was very eye-opening, and it was something that, man, I think all of our teachers need just to do.”The school wasn't able to bus meals to students over the summer, instead offering a hot lunch on campus and in a nearby town. But the effort resumed when school started up virtually in the fall.Then, when school returned for four days a week midway through the fall semester, only about 70% of the district’s students came back for in-person learning. And the district briefly put classes online for all students around Thanksgiving when COVID-19 cases increased. So taking meals to students has continued. An aide drives the school van four days a week to drop off remote students’ lunches. And on Wednesdays, when all students are learning from home, the district runs a bus route to deliver meals to students who signed up. Commuting helps teachers know their districts For the teachers, taking meals around on school buses provided an unexpected and often heartbreaking benefit to the pandemic: knowing their communities better.  “It shows commitment and understanding of the mission that everyone is involved and ready to serve,” said Allen Pratt, executive director of the National Rural Education Association. At Stanfield, about 25% of the district's 72 staff members live in the community, said Superintendent Melissa Sadorf. The K-8 district includes parts of the Tohono O’odham Nation Reservation.  “The rest do commute,” Sadorf wrote in an email. “That definitely plays into not knowing all of the community in an in-depth way.” Sixty-five percent of the families in the district are Hispanic, Sadorf said. The next highest demographic is Native American at 20%. The teaching staff is 28% Hispanic, 12% Native American, 28% white, 16% Black and 16% Asian. Many of the commuting teachers volunteered to deliver food over the district’s 600 square miles beginning in mid-March. Because of the high number of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch, all students at the school eat free.  Before mid-March, the school was feeding 375 students, Sadorf said. After the school closed, the number rose to about 425 area children a day. “I didn't realize the depth and the breadth of need in terms of food until we started this program and started seeing the numbers of people that were showing up to get food,” Sadorf said. “If we hadn't stepped in ... there are a lot of people that would have been hungry, a lot of kids that would have gone hungry.” This fall, the district offered meals for pickup for students who are learning online. Around 75 children also had meals and a place to learn at school early in the school year, before face-to-face learning began. Long bus routes, crowded homes for some children People who have lived in the area for much of their lives, like Garland, were not aware of how some of their neighbors were living. Garland, who is one of seven children, was born in Southern California. When she was 3, her parents moved the family to Stanfield. She attended Stanfield from kindergarten through eighth grade. Both of her parents took jobs with the Stanfield School District; her father worked in the transportation department and her mother worked as a teacher’s aide. Neither of her parents graduated high school, but both were inspired to get their GEDs. Even though her parents drove the school bus at one point, Garland never saw the reservation before this spring. The length of some of the bus routes surprised her. “That made you stop and realize that little kids, especially the small ones, would have to get up so early in the morning to be able to catch the bus to be able to get to school,” Garland said.  It became clear why some of her Native American students did not stay late for tutoring or came to school with homework not done. “If they stay till 5 o'clock for our innovation programs and it ... might be 6, 7 o'clock before they got home,” Garland said.  Another area of the district that stuck with her was Hidden Valley Estates, a mobile home park. Multiple families shared a single trailer, making it difficult for students to have quiet space to do homework or have uninterrupted sleep, Garland said.  Stanfield second-grade teacher Stephonie Martin was another teacher riding the buses out to the Tohono O’odham Nation during the school year.  Martin, with her three daughters, relocated from Jamaica three years ago to teach at the school. She commutes from outside the district. This spring was the first time she had seen how some of her students were living.  “It was a little overwhelming on the first day because I felt guilty in some ways in terms of my expectations,” Martin said. Martin knows children's struggles at home carry into the classroom. Needs like food must be addressed for students to be able to focus on their studies.    “Right now, I feel like there's so much more that I need to do for my students to help (them) to want to succeed, to help them to know that my classroom is a safe space that they can be themselves and be kids more than anything else,” Martin said. “We've not made it our priority to be aware,” Martin said of the larger community. She hopes the pandemic changes that.  Months later, Martin says, her colleagues are stepping up. In her classroom, Martin has stocked warm clothing for her 20 students. In the past, she kept only four jackets for kids to use on cold days. Sadorf says she plans to continue using bus rides as part of the staff’s professional development, and she plans to continue to invite tribal elders to school to help educate staff about Tohono O’odham culture.  For Martin, the rides made a lasting difference. “I understand so much more my role as a teacher in this community,” she said.
Smithsonian abandons $2 billion expansion plan unveiled in 2014 | "When the Smithsonian introduced a futuristic plan for the 17 acres around its iconic administration building, the National Historic Landmark known as the Castle, officials predicted it would be a game-changer that would remake the structure into a visitor gateway to the storied institution. Six years later, a new Smithsonian administration has jettisoned the eye-popping elements of the $2 billion design by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, opting instead for a dramatically downsized version. Set to be presented publicly for the first time this week, the scaled-back plan focuses on the renovation and restoration of the James Renwick-designed Castle and the adjacent Arts and Industries Building (AIB), another National Historic Landmark designed by Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze. “It’s simply the evolutionary process, me coming in and asking certain questions,” Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III said Monday about the decision. The Smithsonian Castle needs a major renovation, but the popular museums keep getting the cash. The Bjarke Ingels Group proposal was unveiled with great fanfare in late 2014 as a reimagining of the campus on the southern edge of the Mall, stretching from the Freer Gallery of Art at 12th Street to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden at Seventh Street. The splashy concept had been in development for two years, with construction expected to begin this year. Officials estimated it would take 20 to 30 years to complete its multiple phases. The Smithsonian spent $5.5 million on architecture and research fees associated with the project. The downsized version — to be introduced at a meeting with community leaders Wednesday and to the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) on Thursday — will not feature the “Blade Runner”-esque plaza, new Mall-facing entrances to the National Museum of African Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and new underground space for food, restrooms and retail. Officials have also abandoned plans to relocate the loading dock to expand the garden behind the Castle and the seismic protection that would have placed the historic structure on a shock-absorbing dish. Instead, the revised project calls for interior and exterior restoration of the Castle, interior and underground work on the AIB and a new central underground utility plant serving those structures and, eventually, the Freer and the underground Quadrangle building. That structure, built in 1987, houses the Ripley Center, Sackler Gallery and African art museum. The work is expected to take at least four years; officials have yet to disclose the cost. Bunch played down the significance of the new plan for the area, saying that he inherited the master plan when he became secretary in 2019 and that he has delegated it to Kevin Gover, acting undersecretary for museums and culture. But Bunch said the Smithsonian looks forward to working with the NCPC, an agency that he worked with during the design and construction of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. “We have to move forward in a way that works for the Smithsonian and NCPC,” he said. “When I dealt with NCPC, their comments always made me better.” ",
Carolyn Hax: A parent pooh-poohs a non-parent’s sleep-deprivation | "Dear Carolyn: I have kids who are 8 months old and 2 years old, so when a childless friend told me she had been sleep-deprived, I just laughed and told her she doesn't know what sleep-deprived is. She didn't say anything about it in the moment, but then later sent me an email detailing health problems she's had related to insomnia and telling me she thought I was insensitive. I replied, "You're acting like this is personal about you. I'm just telling you, no parent wants to hear a non-parent whine about not sleeping." She didn't reply to that and I had basically forgotten about it, but I saw her yesterday and she was very cold to me. Do you think I should address this with her again? It's not that I'm unsympathetic if she's really having problems sleeping, it's just that it's fairly ridiculous for her to compare what she's going through to what parents of young children go through. — "Sleep Deprived". “Sleep Deprived”: Yes, so so ridiculous, because parents of young children are the only ones whose experiences are actually valid! Yes! Are your kids named Holier and Thou? Holy headsmack. Not only were you awful to this friend, but you also took her patient explanation as an opportunity to be awful to her all over again! And you still don’t see it. You’re doubling down. There is no suffering Olympics, no gold medal to be won, there is only suffering. And I’m just telling you (ugh!) that no suffering person wants to hear another person dismiss their suffering as a ludicrous yeah-whatever WHINE. You called a sick friend a whiner. And you did this even though you presumably have firsthand knowledge that sleep deprivation is a form of torture! But instead of tapping into that to feel some empathy for your friend, you used it against her. Hard. Please lose the certainty of your place at the top of the experience mountain and work on your empathy skills, stat. And “address this” with your friend “again” only if you’re prepared to deliver an abject and heartfelt apology for treating her pain as nothing more than the “ridiculous” pretender to your own. You can tell her you responded so badly because you, too, are sleep-deprived and are clearly not at your best at putting 2 and 2 together. This part is not necessary to my argument, but I will spell it out anyway: You are not sleeping well because you are caring for little people who do not yet sleep all night without needing your care. This is not only a choice you made, but also — in the vast majority of cases — a temporary state of things, after which you will be better able to rest. In other words, it is not your body betraying you to the point that it’s denying you your ability to do what you desperately need, and not responding to efforts to fix the problem, and with no end in sight. That’s your friend’s current status. So scoffing at that? Gets a “wow.” ",
Ireland had one of the lowest coronavirus rates in Europe. It’s now highest in the world. | " In the last weeks of 2020, Ireland had one of the lowest coronavirus cases per capita in the European Union. Today, it has the highest in the entire world. While countries across Europe battle a third wave, in Ireland, the trajectory in recent weeks isn’t just an upward curve: It’s the path of a rocket ship. Going into Christmas week, Ireland was reporting 10 new coronavirus cases each day per 100,000 residents — compared with about 66 cases per 100,000 residents in the United States. But three weeks later, Ireland is reporting more than 132 new cases per 100,000, according to the latest seven-day rolling average compiled by Johns Hopkins University, while the United States has risen less dramatically, to about 75 cases per 100,000. “I think we’ve run out of adjectives to describe how serious this is,” Irish health chief Paul Reid said. The reasons behind the rapid rise are under debate, but relaxed restrictions around Christmas may have helped fuel the spread. There is also increasing concern about the “U.K. variant,” which is estimated to be up to 70 percent more transmissible than previous forms of the coronavirus. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said Monday that people mixing over Christmas and the arrival of the new variant created a “perfect storm.” He noted that the latest testing showed 42 out of 92 new samples were positive for the variant — so nearly half. Public health officials in Ireland, which has fewer intensive care beds than most European Union countries, are highly concerned about the strain on the health-care system. Former CDC director Tom Frieden tweeted about the “exponential increases” in Ireland and Britain. “I’ve never seen an epidemic curve like this, and the curve is with lockdown. If the variant becomes common the U.S., it’s close to a worst-case scenario, with a baseline of full hospitals,” he said. It wasn’t long ago that Ireland was being praised for the success of its coronavirus response. In October, it became the first E.U. country to reimpose a nationwide lockdown, while many neighboring countries were only willing to pursue regional restrictions in hot-spot areas. That early and radical move thoroughly tamped down Ireland’s second wave. But the Irish government lifted some measures in December, reopening restaurants and retail stores. People began to go out again. They socialized. They met up over the holidays. This appears to have coincided with the arrival of the more contagious variant. Irish leaders on Monday defended their decisions. “We accept our responsibility, but we have acted at all times in responding effectively to the waves that have emerged,” Martin told the radio show Newstalk. Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar noted that the third wave was lashing many European countries and said it was “too simplistic . . . to say that if one thing had been done differently, everything would be fine.” He suggested five factors may have contributed to Ireland’s spike: the opening up of hospitality in December, the mixing of households, people fanning out across the country before Christmas, noncompliance at funerals and wakes and the rise of shebeens (illicit drinking shops), and the new variant. “You don’t go from 400 cases a day and a 5 percent positivity rate to 7,000 cases and a 25 percent positivity rate because of one thing. It takes a lot of things,” Varadkar told Newstalk. “If you take those five factors together, that’s probably the best explanation that can be given.” The startling figures have prompted questions about whether a rethink is needed for which measures are effective against the fast-spreading variant. Whereas most of Europe was committed to keeping schools open through the second wave, Ireland’s resumed lockdown includes the closure of schools. Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said that it was “foolish and misguided” to loosen restrictions for Christmas, which led to more mixing, when the “clear public health advice is it was the wrong thing to do.” He also said Ireland, as well as Britain, have paid the price for being among the few places in the world without tight controls on airports and ports. Both have announced tougher restrictions in recent days, with air passengers being required to show a negative test taken up to 72 hours before departure. Scally said, too, that Ireland hasn’t taken advantage of its island status the way places such as New Zealand and Taiwan have. There is constant movement across the invisible border that separates the Republic of Ireland, in the south, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom and has its own semiautonomous government. He said some people had taken advantage of the open border and done a “Dublin dodge.” When Ireland joined dozens of other countries in slapping a travel ban on Britain after the variant was identified, there were numerous reports of passengers flying into Belfast, in Northern Ireland, and then just driving across the border to the south. Both Ireland and Northern Ireland are now in strict lockdowns, and they adopted similar measures in the spring. But the two jurisdictions took different approaches in the late autumn, with Northern Ireland imposing a lighter touch. “Northern Ireland had been three or four times higher than the Republic of Ireland three or four weeks ago,” said Peter Donaghy, a data analyst, who added that officials in Northern Ireland dithered and disagreed over restrictions. Northern Ireland hospitals are under stress, with one on Sunday calling in all off-duty staff. Scally called on the governments to take an all-island approach to covid-19. “They would have done if it had been a disease of cattle, pigs or sheep,” he said, referring to bans on the movement of livestock during an outbreak of animal disease. Lindsay Broadbent, a virologist at Queen’s University Belfast, agreed there should be a more unified approach. “There needs to be recognition of that, not just in Ireland, that viruses don’t infect people differently depending on which side of the border you live on,” she said.",
The world in 2030 may be worse than in 2020 | "If you’re like me, you were probably flooded with jubilant messages and memes about the end of 2020. Our black swan year of crisis and calamity, plague and polarization, is over. And in 2021, there are reasons for optimism, not least as countries around the world roll out the first phases of coronavirus vaccine plans. But the broader picture could yet be quite grim. This past week marked the formal start of a new decade. To kick it off, Today’s WorldView spotlights three trendlines that could define the years to come. Changing demographics According to a 2015 U.N. study, the world is expected to have a population of about 8.5 billion people in 2030 — about a 15 percent increase in the size of humanity in just 15 years. India will have surpassed China to become the world’s most populous nation, while demographers forecast a pronounced population surge in sub-Saharan Africa, which will soon be home to the world’s most youthful societies. The number of megacities may double by the end of the decade, with close to two-thirds of humanity living in urban centers. In addition, by 2030, more than a billion people on the planet will be over the age of 65, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. That’s due to longer life expectancies and improving living standards around the world. But the maturing of the world population — not just in the West, but throughout Asia and Latin America, too — carries real policy conundrums. European governments are already grappling with a future shaped by rising costs for elder care, the consequences of declining populations and a shrinking workforce. The political solutions to these long-term challenges may include encouraging more immigration to fill jobs and weakening social protections to drive worker productivity. Demographic anxieties will almost certainly take up greater space in Western politics: On both sides of the Atlantic, far-right movements increasingly see anti-feminism as a rallying cry at a time of declining birthrates. China’s authoritarian leadership is all too aware of the need to pivot given its aging population and has set about trying to reorient the Chinese economy to cater more to a domestic market after years of export-driven boom. In a decade’s time, we may also know whether India’s youth glut — more than half of its population is under 25 — has turned into either a demographic boon or a curse. The world’s largest democracy is already struggling to support its vast population of young people with adequate education, health care and jobs. The deepening toll of climate change 2030 represents a major milestone for the international organizations and climate scientists that have been climate change’s doleful town criers. Two years ago, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without huge, unprecedented cuts to carbon emissions over the next decade, the world would place itself on the brink of climate disaster. Subsequent studies suggested that, even if the demands of climate activists were met, it would take decades to measure any discernible effects. There are reasons for hope. Myriad governments have embraced ambitious plans to transition their economies toward being carbon neutral. The incoming Biden administration intends to add momentum to global climate efforts abandoned by President Trump, while Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that China plans to decrease its carbon footprint to at least 65 percent of where it was in 2005 by 2030. The World Economic Forum — a bastion of optimism — foresees a future in 2030 in which urban centers are transformed into zones shaped by pedestrian activity, technology increasingly obviates the need to own cars, fewer people eat meat, people breathe cleaner air and renewable, clean energy dominates the energy sector. That’s the rosy view. The demands of a rising middle class in the developing world may prove a challenge to decarbonization efforts, while climate skepticism may further drive a host of right-wing movements in the West as their opponents go green. Rather than a warning to the world, melting ice caps in the Arctic are already opening new trade lanes and avenues for exploration, stoking a new era of geopolitical competition. All the while, scientists predict an increasing number of extreme weather events wracking the world and destabilizing vulnerable communities. The mess of global governance The past decade shifted our view of global politics. Long gone is any certainty in the inexorability of liberal democracy — single-party states still flourish, while demagogic populism and far-right nationalism are powerful forces within many of the world’s major democracies. Rights groups warn of the erosion of once-healthy democracies and new threats to freedom and privacy posed by government cyber surveillance. Visions of a robust liberal world order have given way to white papers on the return of great-power competition. That includes the new race over research and the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is predicted to add some $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. China has poured vast resources into its tech sector and is arguably the global pacesetter in the development and implementation of AI technologies, an advantage that has huge political implications. “Whoever leads in artificial intelligence in 2030 will rule the world till 2100,” declared a recent policy briefing from the Brookings Institution. Liberals in the West hope the serious challenges of the next decade — all of which require expanded international cooperation and coordination — will eventually dispel the angry nationalism of the present. But we may see even more disruption: The current polarization in the United States, exemplified by Trump and his allies’ refusal to accept the verdict of the November election, could prefigure an even worse constitutional crisis in coming years. The European Union’s project of integration could stall or collapse, buffeted both by fiscal crises and populist passions. And in Africa, the continent’s much-touted (and much-needed) plan for an integrated free trade zone is still struggling to get off the ground."
Trump administration reverses stance, will no longer hold back second shots of coronavirus vaccine | The Trump administration will announce sweeping changes to its vaccination rollout on Tuesday, including making many more doses of the coronavirus vaccine available and urging states to provide shots to anyone 65 and older. The steps are an effort to speed up a delayed and disjointed rollout. The changes are a sharp departure from the administration’s previous strategy, and they come just days after President-elect Joe Biden announced plans to release nearly all the vaccine supply. Biden is expected to provide a detailed blueprint on reinvigorating the rollout later this week. The Trump administration has been holding back roughly half the vaccines to ensure sufficient supply for people to get a required second shot. But in draft remarks prepared for a scheduled call Tuesday afternoon with governors and obtained by The Washington Post, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar disclosed the change in plans. The remarks were confirmed by a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The expectation is that people will still get their second doses as planned. The concerns about possible hiccups in manufacturing have been allayed by the steady ramp-up so far, while the risks of delay have increased as the pandemic has claimed thousands of lives daily and as a new, more contagious variant of the virus first identified in Great Britain spreads through the United States. Azar also will announce plans to expand the venues where people can get inoculated, including at community health centers, and offer technical assistance from the National Guard or Federal Emergency Management Agency for states seeking to set up mass vaccination sites as they expand populations prioritized for immunization, according to the remarks. Administration officials will also recommend that the vaccines be made available to anyone 65 and over, and to adults who have a preexisting condition that puts them at greater risk for severe illness, sharply increasing the number of people who will be eligible for the shots, according to Axios and confirmed by the administration official. The decisions to overhaul the vaccine distribution program were made in two meetings held by leadership of Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s efforts to develop and distribute vaccines and therapeutics, over the weekend as officials searched for ways to speed up a sluggish rollout, the official said. The changes are expected to be announced Tuesday in a media call by Warp Speed, and in a call with the governors later in the day. During the two Warp Speed meetings, which included officials from the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, data showed that vaccine administration has been slowed because states and health-care providers are adhering too rigidly to guidance about priority groups while manufacturing has steadily increased, the official said. “States have to expand. It’s like boarding an airplane. Your group gets called, but you don’t wait for everyone before you announce the next group,” the official said. Nearly 40 million doses are available to states now, the official said. The latest figures show that more than 25 million doses of the two authorized vaccines have been distributed, with nearly 9 million doses administered as of Monday at 9 a.m., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A second dose of the vaccine can be ensured by holding it in reserve or by “a dose coming off the manufacturing and quality control checks,” Azar’s prepared remarks said. “To that end, over the next two weeks, the final doses we held in reserve will be shipped out based on orders. Going forward, each week, the doses available will be released to first cover the needed second doses and then cover additional first vaccinations.” Azar’s remarks were prepared for a call that is scheduled to be led by Vice President Pence. The health secretary’s comments were widely circulated among HHS officials and shared with The Post. The changes to be announced Tuesday appear to be similar to what Biden proposed last week. The Warp Speed plan is to release “a steady cadence for second shots and new additional first shots,” the official said. “If anything were to happen [with manufacturing,] you would cover the second doses first and pause any additional first ones.” Azar is expected to acknowledge “bottlenecks” in the vaccination effort and said progress in getting shots into arms has been “highly uneven.” He is set to reiterate the administration’s position that states do not need to rigidly adhere to vaccinating one priority group before moving to the next. “There is no reason that states need to complete, say, vaccinating all health-care providers before opening up vaccinations to older Americans or other especially vulnerable populations, while continuing to work to finish vaccinating those in the first stage.” Last week, Azar had announced the federal government was accelerating a plan to distribute coronavirus vaccines through retail pharmacies. That program allows states to allocate vaccines directly to these pharmacies, and pharmacies can then administer the vaccine to certain groups. The pharmacies will handle scheduling appointments and reporting numbers of vaccinations, Azar said. Officials are also “working to activate” federally qualified health centers that serve low-income and minority populations for vaccination. Some centers are already being used for the vaccination effort, Azar said. While officials with the federal Warp Speed vaccine effort have always described the decision to reserve second doses as a temporary strategy, they had not said when they planned to alter it. The administration has repeatedly defended its practice of holding back 50 percent of the vaccine supply, saying it is critical to ensure that everyone who gets a first shot is guaranteed a second one at the right time, even if manufacturing problems were to disrupt supply. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines — the only two coronavirus vaccines that have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration — were shown in clinical trials this year to be highly effective when administered in a two-shot regimen. The second Pfizer shot is given after 21 days, and the second Moderna shot after 28 days. But critics of withholding 50 percent of supply have said it is an overly conservative approach at a time when a raging pandemic is killing thousands of Americans a day. They have argued that it is imperative for the nation to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, saying it’s important to prevent a more transmissible variant of the virus, like the one that fueled a surge of infections in Britain, from gaining a foothold in the United States. In addition, they have noted that the Pfizer and Moderna manufacturing processes have not had major hiccups. And many scientists have said that even if there is a slight delay — a few days, or a couple of weeks in someone getting a second dose — it wouldn’t be a major problem. In this view, holding back available doses is wrong, as long as there is high confidence the vaccine production will continue uninterrupted. But that view has its own skeptics, in part because many states and localities have not been able to use the vaccine they already have in a timely way. “If I were confident we were efficiently using all the doses that are being distributed and that the supply was getting low, then I could understand releasing a lot more doses to meet demand,” said Stephen Ostroff, former acting commissioner of the FDA. He was reacting to the Biden plan and did not know about the new Trump plan. “But we have lots of vaccines floating around the system and we don’t have the ability to get into people’s arms,” he said, saying the most needed step to speed up shots is to add vaccination sites and staff to administer the inoculations. Others note that some parts of the country have unused supply, while others do not have enough. As states and localities move from vaccinating health-care workers and staff and residents of long-term care facilities to lower-priority groups in the next several weeks, public health officials predict that much more supply will be needed.
