The local politics of AirBNB’s ban on DC rentals | On January 9—three days after supporters of President Trump started a riot at the US Capitol—Sean Evans decided it was time for action. Evans had seen a post on Nextdoor about neighbors running into hostile Trump supporters the night of the riot, leading to a verbal altercation that had left residents of his corner of Northwest DC on edge. Now, rumors flew online that the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden would bring more protesters and more armed violence to the streets of his city. “I don’t want them in my neighborhood,” Evans thought to himself. In fact, he didn't want insurrectionists in the city at all.So on Nextdoor, Evans asked his neighbors to stop renting out their properties via Airbnb and VRBO. A few hours later, another neighbor devised a hashtag: #DontRentDC.Separately, a group called ShutDownDC gathered 500 volunteers to message DC area Airbnb hosts. The group sent messages to the managers of 3,400 properties in the region—polite ones, according to ShutDownDC organizer Alex Dodd. The messages alerted the Airbnb hosts to an upcoming threat and asked them to please refrain from booking anyone in their homes in the days surrounding the inauguration.It worked. On Wednesday, Airbnb said it would cancel and block all Washington area reservations next week. Guests who had booked reservations would be refunded; if hosts had reservations or had canceled them recently, they would be reimbursed for the lost income. Airbnb spokesperson Ben Breit said the company “came to this decision following dialog with Washington, DC, officials, the Metro police department, and members of Congress.” (Earlier in the week, DC’s mayor had asked people not to travel to the inauguration; many customary inaugural events will happen online.)For Airbnb, the incident is a reminder that all its politics is local. The company, now publicly traded with a value of more than $100 billion, has made its reputation on selling visitors on neighborhood authenticity. But its business model has at times made it a lightning rod for local affairs and left it scrambling to solve social ills. Airbnb has battled with local governments to allow short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods. It has tussled with local officials over taxes and data sharing. It has reshaped the economies of tiny vacation towns. It has tried to prevent big parties in rentals, which have sometimes led to violence. More recently, it has met with the ire of neighbors who don’t want virus-stricken out-of-towners filling up their overloaded ICUs.In DC this month, residents first tried to respond to insurrectionist violence themselves. Evans, the NextDoor organizer, believed it was easier that way. “I thought it would probably be more difficult for me to get Airbnb management to look at any email we sent them. So I thought, ‘Let’s try to do this from the ground up and contact neighbors within our vicinity.’” Most property owners he contacted were nice about it, he says. Some didn’t know about the security threats surrounding the inauguration. Others asked, Why don’t you get in touch with Airbnb about this?On the other side of the equation, some Airbnb hosts were frustrated by the company’s inaction in the days immediately following the insurrection. They had received messages from neighbors; they wanted to help. But they also didn’t want to lose income during a recession. On Monday, Airbnb released a Capitol Safety Plan outlining additional reviews and booking requirements for guests in the DC area. Beyond that, renters were left to decide about letting out their properties themselves.One Airbnb host, who asked not to be identified, has been renting the top floors of his home through Airbnb for a year. (DC regulations require homeowners to live on the property of their short-term rentals, though hosts say those rules often are ignored.) Right before Christmas, he approved a reservation for a group to stay in his apartment for what the renter called a “history sightseeing trip.” On the morning of January 6, he noticed the group filing out the front door in Trump gear. When he saw what was happening at the Capitol, he was freaked out. He called the Airbnb emergency support line to seek advice, and the service agent promised to call him back. He left for a friend’s because he didn’t feel comfortable sticking around to find out who or what the renters would bring back.Then, a 2021 twist: as the renters returned to his house ahead of the city’s emergency 6pm curfew, they gathered on the porch, activating the man’s Ring camera. “I stormed the Capitol!” he could hear them brag to each other. Airbnb support didn’t call back.“Each host was basically on their own,” the host says. After a potential renter canceled for inauguration week, he decided to pull the dates from Airbnb himself. Breit, the Airbnb spokesperson, says the company “apologizes that this case was not urgently escalated as it should have been when [the host] contacted our Community Support team.” The host sent the Ring footage to the FBI, and Airbnb says the renter has been suspended pending an investigation.
CDPR CEO blames “in-game streaming” for Cyberpunk’s console problems | CD Projekt Red is still trying to contain the damage from widespread reports of major technical problems in the versions of Cyberpunk 2077 released for the PS4 and Xbox One last month. To that end, studio co-founder and CEO Marcin Iwinski today tweeted a video message seeking to explain the internal situation leading up to the problematic launch. "Despite good reviews on PC, the console version of Cyberpunk 2077 did not meet the quality standard we wanted it to meet," Iwinski said in the message. "I, and the entire leadership team, are deeply sorry for this, and this video is me publicly owning up to that." Sifting through the stream The core of the problem, Iwinski said, was the "in-game streaming system" that Cyberpunk 2077 used to "feed" content and game mechanics to the engine without frequent breaks for loading. That system had to be "constantly improved" for last-gen consoles during development, Iwinski said, in order to keep up with the "epic" look of the PC version (which saw its graphics and other assets scaled down to work on more limited, older console hardware). "Things did not look super difficult at first, [but] I think that time has proven we underestimated the task," Iwinski said. "Because the city is so packed and the disk bandwidth of old-gen consoles is what it is, it constantly challenged us." Iwinski was less direct about why these problems with the console versions weren't discovered and either fixed or delayed before launch. "Every change and improvement needed to be tested, and as it turned out, our testing did not show a big part of the issues you experienced while playing the game," Iwinski said. He added that communication problems caused by the team working from home amid COVID-related restrictions meant some issues got lost over video calls or emails. "We saw significant improvements each and every day leading up to release [and] really thought we'd deliver in the day zero [version on consoles]," he said. Iwinski said these late-in-development improvements and constant testing on consoles were the reason review code for the console versions of the game was not offered to reviewers alongside PC code in early December. While Iwinski said console code was sent out December 8 (later than was originally planned), Ars Technica was not provided with any console version to test before the game's launch on December 10 (much less ahead of the initial PC review embargo on December 7). Iwinski's statement also doesn't address the significant (but less-than-game-breaking) bugs initially found in the PC version of the game. As we stated in our review of the PC version, "non-hostile characters will stand motionless in midair, stuck in a ridiculous T-pose, or pace back and forth in tight corridors for no reason. People phase in and out of existence before my eyes. A crowded table at a club will feature one drink hovering in the hands of an invisible patron." Moving forward In addition to three hotfixes already released, Iwinski reiterated a promise for a major update dropping "within 10 days" and another significant update "in the following weeks." After that, the development team will focus on previously promised free DLC and free updates for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X-native versions of the game, now expected in the second half of 2021.Iwinski's latest message follows a December conference call in which he admitted the CDPR leadership team "ignored the signals about the need for additional time to refine the game on the base last-gen consoles." Since that call, the game has been delisted from both the PlayStation and Xbox online stores, and CD Projekt Red has been faced with a lawsuit from unhappy shareholders.
Last year reusable rockets entered the mainstream, and there’s no going back | The notion of reusing rockets finally went mainstream in 2020. As the year progressed, it became clear that SpaceX launch customers have gotten a lot more comfortable with flying on used, or "flight-proven," first stages of the Falcon 9 rocket. One commercial customer, Sirius, launched its XM-7 satellite on the seventh flight of a Falcon 9 booster in December. Also, the first national security payload flew on a reused booster last month when the US National Reconnaissance Office launched its NROL-108 mission on the fifth flight of a Falcon 9 first stage. NASA, too, agreed to fly future crewed missions to the International Space Station—beginning with the Crew-2 spaceflight in the spring of 2021—on used Falcon 9 rockets. And the US Space Force said it would launch its GPS III satellites on used boosters in the future as well. These are among the highest-value missions the United States has. Another important step came when a second US launch company, Rocket Lab, began to demonstrate rocket reuse. The company experimented throughout 2020 on ways to protect the return of its Electron first stage during reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Then, it recovered an Electron stage for the first time in November. "When we look back on 2020, we will say this year was a watershed moment," said Randy Kendall, vice president of launch and enterprise operations for The Aerospace Corporation, in an interview. "Commercial, civil, and national security missions have all signaled their intent to fly their most precious payloads on previously flown rockets." A long time coming NASA deserves credit for pioneering work in reusable spaceflight. The space shuttle was the world's first partially reusable launch system, with the orbiter and solid rocket boosters capable of multiple flights after significant refurbishment. But it wasn't cheap—the best independent estimate of the shuttle's cost over the lifetime of the program is about $1.5 billion per launch. In the 1990s, NASA then funded the Delta Clipper program to test vertical takeoff and vertical landing. Eventually, it would launch reusable DC-X vehicles 12 times from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, reaching a maximum altitude of 3km. The program was canceled in 1996 after an accident and due to a lack of funding. With its Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceX carried forward the concept of vertically launching and landing a rocket. And from the shuttle, SpaceX learned that it was not enough to build a reusable rocket. A launch vehicle also had to be rapidly reusable, and at a lower cost. SpaceX is getting there, as it has cut turnaround times for the use of a Falcon 9 core to less than two months. And while the Falcon 9 is smaller and less capable than the shuttle, its per-mission cost is substantially less than $50 million, or 3 percent of a shuttle flight. "People who have been in this industry for awhile have been looking at this, and hoping for awhile it would happen, and then all of a sudden you have a tipping point," Kendall said. "There was no doubt the physics could be conquered, it was a question of whether the economics could be conquered. In the future, I think most companies will have some element reuse. Everyone I’ve talked to is thinking about it. The Europeans, Chinese, and Russians all have plans for reuse within the next decade." Falcon 9 It has now been five years since SpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket in December 2015. Since then, the company has returned about 70 additional rockets and re-flown a booster 49 times. During the same time period, SpaceX's main competitor, United Launch Alliance, has flown its expendable Atlas V rocket 26 times. "We have flown more flight proven boosters than Atlas has flown in the last five years," said Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX. As recycled Falcon 9 first stages have flown often and completed their primary missions with 100 percent success, SpaceX customers and their insurers have gained confidence in the vehicle. "We're demonstrating what we're demonstrating," Shotwell said. "On the commercial side, the insurance community responded appropriately to it. There's not a premium that needs to get paid for flight proven. I remember doing the first briefing to the underwriter saying, 'Look, you guys are going to want people to fly flight proven. You're going to see that it's easier to get off the deck when you've already flown that rocket. You wring out the issues on the first flight.'" By investing in reuse, SpaceX has not only been able to significantly cut its cost per launch, it has also freed up a lot of factory space at its main factory in Hawthorne, California, because it no longer has to build nine new Merlin engines and a first stage core for each flight. "It's great that we didn't have to get to 40 cores in a year with Falcon 9, because we were trying to figure out layout of factory to do that," Shotwell said. "And booster production obviously takes a ton of floor space. Not having to build 40 boosters in a year is super helpful to the company's ability to flex and do work on other projects, there's no question about it. We moved some Falcon folks into Dragon. We're moving some Falcon and Dragon folks into Starship, of course." Electron Rocket Lab is seeking to increase its production capabilities with reuse, too. By reusing a first stage once, Rocket Lab cofounder Peter Beck said the company could double his production capability and catch up to customer demand. Beck said he was originally skeptical about reuse, especially for smaller orbital rockets. When Rocket Lab first began developing its Electron rocket nearly a decade ago, SpaceX had not yet successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket. In fact, when SpaceX built its first rocket, the smaller Falcon 1—only a little bit bigger than Electron—the company had tried to reuse it. For each mission, a parachute was supposed to extend from the first stage. But SpaceX never came close to successfully fishing an intact Falcon 1 first stage out of the ocean. Only in 2017 and 2018, as Electron began flying and Beck studied flight data, did he come to believe his rocket could be safely brought back to Earth. Now, having completed some preliminary tests and planning more recoveries in 2021, Beck has become a convert. "If Rocket Lab ever builds a new vehicle, it will fundamentally be reusable from day one," he said. "I’m really surprised when I see new vehicles in development now that aren’t reusable."
One piece of optical hardware performs massively parallel AI calculations | AI and machine-learning techniques have become a major focus of everything from cloud computing services to cell phone manufacturers. Unfortunately, our existing processors are a bad match for the sort of algorithms that many of these techniques are based on, in part because they require frequent round trips between the processor and memory. To deal with this bottleneck, researchers have figured out how to perform calculations in memory and designed chips where each processing unit has a bit of memory attached. Now, two different teams of researchers have figured out ways of performing calculations with light in a way that both merges memory and calculations and allows for massive parallelism. Despite the differences in implementation, the hardware designed by these teams has a common feature: it allows the same piece of hardware to simultaneously perform different calculations using different frequencies of light. While they're not yet at the level of performance of some dedicated processors, the approach can scale easily and can be implemented using on-chip hardware, raising the prospect of using it as a dedicated co-processor.A fine-toothed comb The new work relies on hardware called a frequency comb, a technology that won some of its creators the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics. While a lot of interesting physics is behind how the combs work (which you can read more about here), what we care about is the outcome of that physics. While there are several ways to produce a frequency comb, they all produce the same thing: a beam of light that is composed of evenly spaced frequencies. So a frequency comb in visible wavelengths might be composed of light with a wavelength of 500 nanometers, 510nm, 520nm, and so on.The metaphor is a comb—a large array of evenly spaced teeth—but the reality underlying the metaphor is that each of the teeth is a distinct frequency of light. Or, since frequency and wavelength are related, you can view them as evenly spaced wavelengths.We've known for a while that it's possible to perform calculations using light. What the frequency comb does is allow a convenient means for those calculations to be massively parallel. If the frequency comb described above were sent through hardware that manipulated visible wavelengths, every single one of its component frequencies would perform the same calculation, essentially making its operation massively parallel. On its own, that's not especially useful, unless you really want the results of a calculation confirmed.But some types of frequency combs allow each wavelength to be adjusted independently, increasing or lowering the intensity of each of the teeth. This allows different calculations to be performed with each tooth in the comb while retaining the massively parallel aspects.One of the types of calculations that maps relatively easy onto light is a matrix multiplication that is heavily used by some AI applications. Specifically, it can be used to perform convolution, a mathematical operation that's part of the deep neural networks that have excelled at image recognition. Both of these papers do end up using their optical hardware to do image work, but they use very different approaches to get there. We'll start with the easier one to understand first.Into the matrix How do you actually perform image operations using light? The first step is to digitize the image. From there, details about each pixel can be encoded in the intensity of light at specific wavelengths of the frequency comb. These wavelengths are then sent into a square grid of phase-change materials. The phase-change material performs operations on the light because it absorbs different amounts of light based on how ordered or disordered the material is. Depending on the path the light takes through the grid, different amounts will be absorbed, with the final intensity being the readout of the operation, which is essentially a vector multiply-accumulate.Critically, the grid can perform that operation on different wavelengths at the same time, so different teeth of the comb can all be fed into the hardware at once. And since the phase-change material is reconfigurable, the whole thing can be reconfigured to perform different operations at will. As is standard for these sorts of demonstration processes, the researchers set the hardware to use a set of handwritten digits that's become a standard in the field. It was able to achieve an accuracy of over 95 percent, which is considered successful.For the demonstration, each of the different pieces of hardware—the laser, the hardware that converts it into a frequency comb, the phase-change memory, and the photon detectors—were all on different chips. But there's nothing stopping them from being integrated onto a single chip, allowing them to be used as an optical co-processor for AI tasks.Two significant limits on its operation are the number of teeth in the frequency comb and the size of the grid of phase-change material, and there are ways of increasing both. Somewhat more challenging to handle is the limits posed by how quickly the optical hardware can operate. Since there may be ways of handling that, the hardware's current operation should be considered a lower bound. But even as a lower bound, it's pretty impressive, capable from operating at 3.8 trillion operations per second.While specialized AI co-processors already exist, they operate on the same principles as regular processors, meaning heat and power become an issue for them, as well. A key potential advantage here is that the heating and power issues here are almost all focused on the laser light source. As long as those issues can be handled, the device can be operated at full tilt without additional worries regarding these issues.A matter of time It should be relatively easy to envision a bunch of photons ping-ponging around a grid of semi-reflective materials. The other paper on the topic relies on a very difficult and less appreciated behavior of light: when light is passing through a material that has a lot of internal refraction, the speed at which the light travels depends on its wavelength.To take advantage of this, the researchers encode information as vectors into a few of the teeth of the frequency comb. That light is then sent down an optical cable that produces different delays at different wavelengths. The detector at the other side of the cable, however, only accepts input during a specific window of time; if the delay shifts some portions of the input vectors out of that time window, then they aren't counted toward the output. In essence, this performs a mathematical operation called a convolution, linking the frequency at which the data was encoded to the weight it's given by the detector based on the timing of its arrival.Again, convolutions are critical to the deep neural networks used for image classification. And many convolutions can be carried out in parallel, since optical cabling can carry a broad range of wavelengths. As a result, the setup used in the paper was able to hit 11.3 trillion operations per second, although its performance on the digit recognition test was somewhat worse, at 88 percent accuracy. While the individual operations are fast, the setup absolutely needs the delay to operate properly, meaning that it will never be able to provide the sort of instantaneous response that some applications require. But its operations can be done using off-the-shelf optical telecom equipment. If all the bands used in modern telecom hardware were put to use for operations, over 400 operations could be performed in parallel. And that's before things like the polarization of the light is used to carry information, which could push performance up to the quadrillion-operations-per-second range.
This is how hominins adapted to a changing world 2 million years ago | The versatility that helped humans take over the world emerged very early in our evolutionary history, according to sediments and stone tools from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Olduvai has provided some of the oldest known tools and fossils from our genus, Homo. A recent study lines that evidence up with environmental clues buried in the sediment. The results suggest that our early relatives were equipped to adapt to new environments by around 2 million years ago. That seems to have been a key ability that allowed our relatives to go global. By 1.7 million years ago, an early human relative called Homo erectus had spread beyond Africa and throughout most of Asia, as far as Indonesia. They had reached western Europe by 1.2 million years ago. Along their travels, the hominins encountered environments very different from the ones their ancestors had evolved in, like the tropical forests of Indonesia and the arid steppes of central Asia. They may have been able to prepare for that simply by staying in one place within Africa. At Ewass Oldupa, a recently excavated site on the edge of the famous Olduvai Gorge, findings indicate that early hominins lived in a constantly shifting landscape. Life after the volcano The oldest evidence we have for early human relatives at Olduvai Gorge is a handful of stone tools, made and used around 2.03 million years ago. Like the other tools unearthed at Ewass Oldupa, they’re part of the Olduwan complex: relatively simple stone tools made by early hominins like H. erectus and H. habilis. Olduwan tools are mostly sharp flakes and very basic tools for chopping, scraping and pounding. They’re much less complex and precise than the tools made by later hominins, like Neanderthals, who chipped small flakes off carefully prepared stone cores. But for a few hundred thousand years, the rough-and-ready Olduwan tools got the job done. At Ewass Oldupa, the job was survival in a landscape of mostly bracken fern meadows dotted with a few grasses and woody plants, watered by a meandering river. The ferns were probably the first plants to put down roots atop the wide fan of pumice that had spewed from a nearby volcano not too long beforehand. Traces of that landscape are still buried in a layer of sediment about a meter above the rocky remains of the ancient pyroclastic flow; paleoanthropologist Michael Petraglia, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, and his colleagues found fossilized pollen and microscopic pieces of fossilized plant tissue called phytoliths in the layer, alongside 10 stone tools. For hunter-gatherers like H. habilis, whose fossilized remains have been unearthed just a few hundred meters away from Ewass Oldupa, the ferny basin would have been a pretty good place to make a living. The river offered ready access to water, and the geology of the area provided several sources of stone for tools. Geochemical analysis of the tools at Ewass Oldupa suggest that hominins here gathered some of their quartzite locally and ventured up to 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away for the rest. They seemed to choose different materials—in some cases as specific as choosing slightly different types of quartzite from different outcrops—for particular tools. (A study last year also suggested that the earliest toolmakers in our family tree knew enough to choose their materials wisely.) But then, as it always does, everything changed. New worlds in the same place Thousands of years later, the hominins who had once foraged by the riverbanks wouldn’t have recognized the landscape around Ewass Oldupa. The meadows of bracken had given way to a patchwork of woods and grasslands around the shores of a lake. Microscopic fossils trapped in the sediment suggest that the plant species that made up those woods and grasslands changed often, and deposits of charcoal reveal that wildfires periodically swept through the area, helping the patchwork landscape rearrange itself. At other points in the area’s long prehistory, the lake expanded, and the muddy sediments of the lakeshore hint at a lush landscape of forests and palm groves. The lakeshore later gave way to a dry steppe, mostly bare of trees and grass. Each of those environments offered wildly different foods, water, supplies, and challenges, but hominins seem to have kept coming back to Ewass Oldupa. “Over the course of time, these habitats sometimes changed slowly or rapidly,” Petraglia told Ars. “It is difficult to know how quickly hominins entered new ecosystems owing to the resolution of the record, but it is clear that they were able to cope with a wide variety of environments.” Petraglia and his colleagues found stone tools left behind by hominins who lived at the site (probably H. habilis) off and on throughout its 200,000 years of constant change. The 565 stone tools, scattered across millennia of layered sediment at the site, don’t look like the detritus of a permanent settlement. Instead, it looks like hominins left the basin several times, maybe due to sudden environmental change or volcanic eruptions, but they kept coming back. “There were a number of volcanic events within the 235,000 year time range represented at Ewass Oldupa,” Petraglia told Ars. “It is interesting that hominins returned to these areas after each of the eruptions—that is, they never entirely abandoned the region.” Jacks of all trades And even if the earliest hunters and gatherers at Ewass Oldupa would have found later versions of the place totally alien, they would still have recognized the tools people used to survive it. For roughly 200,000 years, hominins relied on the same basic tools to tackle the bracken meadows beside the river, the patchwork of woods and grassland, the lush lakeshore, and the dry steppe.The chopping, scraping, and pounding tools of the Olduwan were relatively simple, but they were also incredibly versatile. According to Petraglia and his colleagues, Olduwan technology offered a basic, general toolkit that worked as well in a lakeside palm grove as it did on a dry steppe. Humans took over the world because we’re generalists, and generalists can adapt to nearly anything. Our early relatives clearly had the same advantage.
The immune system and COVID: It’s still confusing | Vaccine trials have made clear that the immune system can mount a robust response to SARS-CoV-2. Beyond that, though, there are a lot of question marks. People exposed to the virus don't always produce much in the way of antibodies to it, and there have been a number of cases of reinfection. We're not sure how long immunity lasts or whether it correlates with antibody levels or something else—there hasn't even been great evidence that antibodies are helpful. To give some sense of the challenge of sorting all of this out, we're going to look at three recently published papers that get at the interplay between the immune system and COVID-19. One finally provides some evidence that antibodies might be protective, another indicates that tamping down the inflammatory response might help, while the third suggests that immunosuppressives don't affect disease outcomes at all. Antibodies good Antibodies are a relatively easy way to track an immune response, and they've been used for that throughout the pandemic. But early studies found the number of antibodies produced in response to an infection varied dramatically between patients. There have also been clinical trials testing whether using antibodies obtained from those formerly infected could help treat those suffering from COVID-19 symptoms, with the FDA eventually granting this a controversial Emergency Use Authorization. US President Donald Trump also received an experimental treatment of mass-produced SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The odd thing about this treatment is that we're not certain that antibodies are actually protective. Further trials of antibody treatments for those infected have produced ambiguous results, with no clear benefit from receiving an antibody boost. And while immunity levels seem to correlate with antibody levels in some studies, we can't be certain that the two aren't both linked to some other aspect of immune function—perhaps antibody levels are simply a reflection of T-cell activity, to give one example. A new paper from researchers in Argentina is small, but it hints that antibodies can help those with COVID-19—but only if a treatment is administered early enough. The research design is solid: a randomized, blinded trial in which some people were given a transfusion of saline solution, while others had antibodies from those infected previously mixed in with their saline. Critically, all transfusions took place within a couple of days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The only limitation of the trial is that it took place while case numbers were dropping in Argentina, so it was cut short once they had trouble recruiting patients. Of the 160 patients that were enrolled, all over 65 years of age, and 25 of the 80 in the control group ended up with severe respiratory symptoms. In those who received the antibody-containing plasma, only 13 experienced these symptoms. Eliminating the six individuals who had to drop out of the study improved the numbers further. Finally, those who received plasma with the highest levels of antibodies in it tended to have an even better prognosis, although the number of patients here is even smaller still. Those who received the plasma also tended to have fewer severe outcomes, such as admission to the ICU and need for ventilation. However, the numbers of each individual issue were all small, so none of these measures reached statistical significance. The researchers note that, in a few other studies, those who received plasma treatments early tended to do better, but the overall population treated at different stages of the infection showed no effect. If this turns out to be right—and this study is small enough that it really needs to be replicated—then it would present the first clear evidence that antibodies are helpful. That could be critical not only for the treatment of those who get infected, but in tracking immunity and monitoring risk in populations with various levels of vaccination. Inflammation bad The other lesson of the antibody study is that defining your treatment population carefully—newly symptomatic elderly, in this case—may be critical for identifying a clear effect, even though it can make it harder to find enough patients to do a thorough study. That lesson may also apply to a draft manuscript that describes a study of whether we can limit the effects of COVID-19 by tamping down on the inflammatory immune response. Studies of the genetics of COVID-19 patients had indicated that variations in some immune signaling molecules were associated with disease severity. But studies of drugs that blocked the effects of an inflammatory signaling molecule called interleukin-6 had shown no effect. The researchers suspected that this was because they accepted a wide range of patients. So, to narrow things down, they started treatments with the interleukin-6 blockers as patients were admitted to the ICU. The trial enrolled about 800 people, about half of whom served as controls. The remainder received one of two different inflammatory blockers. Among those who didn't receive a drug, the mortality rate was about 36 percent. For those who were treated, however, mortality was 27 percent. That may not be an enormous difference, but if it holds up, it could make a significant difference in survival at the population level. And the UK's National Health Service has already alerted its doctors of the results as it starts a re-evaluation of these drugs. Is the immune system overrated? All of this would seemingly place the immune system at the center of COVID-19 outcomes, which shouldn't be in the least bit surprising. But another study published this week raises questions about even that. Here, researchers tracked the outcomes of over 2,000 COVID-19 cases that came through the Johns Hopkins medical system back in March. Of those, over 100 were taking drugs that left them immunocompromised. And when the outcomes of the patients were analyzed, there wasn't a noticeable difference between those who were immunocompromised and the rest of the population. The researchers measured mortality, length of stay, and need for ventilation, but none of them were significantly different. It's important to emphasize that "immunosuppressed" does not mean "incapable of mounting any immune response." But the response is generally quite limited. What to make of all of this? The good news is that, if the antibody results hold up, they indicate that antibodies can provide us not only with a therapy for those at high risk of severe infection, but an easy way of tracking who might be protected in the future. Those results aren't really confused by the results with immunocompromised individuals, since antibodies aren't typically produced during an initial infection unless it drags on for a while (they take a few weeks to start appearing at measurable levels). Beyond that, however, things get very complicated. The immune system has multiple aspects (T-cell based immunity, dendritic cells, innate immunity, etc.), and we don't really know how many of these were fully suppressed in the immunocompromised individuals. In addition, if inflammation does turn out to be harmful in some cases, it's possible that some forms of immunosuppression could actually be helpful. It’s complicated But the big picture that these papers really drive home is that both the immune system and its interactions with this virus are extremely complex. If a study doesn't have enough people to focus on specific patient populations or provide treatments at specific points during the infection, then there's a chance that important effects will be averaged out. One problem is that, at this point, we've got many smaller, less focused studies already published, leading to an incomplete and confused picture. Finally, there's undoubtedly a lot of patient-to-patient variability that confuses things further. All of that explains why there's so many confusing and seemingly contradictory publications out there. This confusion reinforces the need to avoid treating any single result as if it's conclusive. Over time, we will build up a clearer picture of the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune system's response to it. Given the time that will take, however, the focus will undoubtedly be on rushing to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.
SpaceX hot fire tests its Starship vehicle three times in four hours | On Wednesday, in South Texas, SpaceX fired up its newest Starship prototype not once or twice. Rather, engineers and technicians fueled and test fired their SN9 prototype and its Raptor rocket engines three times in less than four hours. After the first of three tests, SpaceX founder and chief engineer Elon Musk said on Twitter, "Today at SpaceX is about practicing Starship engine starts. Ship is held down by massive pins while engines are fired." After the third test, Musk confirmed that all three tests were completed without a major issue. Performing three tests like this in rapid succession is a notable achievement, and it points to maturing spaceship hardware, ground systems, and procedures for SpaceX's Starship launch program. Musk said the goal is to reach a point where one could "hop in and go" to Mars. Such a capability remains years into the future, if it is ever realized. But the company appears to be making progress toward a robust launch system. Assuming data from Wednesday's engine tests is favorable, the next step for SN9 is likely to go and fly. The vehicle is already on its launch stand, and Musk and his engineers will now conduct a "readiness" review in advance of what is expected to be another test flight to about 12.5km, similar to the flight performed by the SN8 vehicle in December. The goal will be to land successfully, after SN8 met a fiery end at the landing site after an otherwise near-perfect flight.  SpaceX has received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to launch its SN9 vehicle on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday from its facility near Boca Chica Beach, in South Texas. It is possible they will be able to turn SN9 around for a flight attempt as soon as Thursday. However there are concerns about upper-level winds, which appear to be hostile until at least Saturday. Sources suggested that SpaceX is eager to get on with flying SN9, as it has nearly completed assembly of the next Starship prototype, SN10, at its nearby high bay facilities. The company is pressing ahead to fly this vehicle perhaps as soon as the end of January, as it has several other prototypes in various states of construction. The near-term goal is to demonstrate an orbital flight capability for Starship. To do this, the company needs to first build and test the Super Heavy rocket, which will serve as Starship's first stage. This dramatic test will see a Starship launched into orbit to determine whether it can safely return to Earth using a combination of heat shield tiles on its atmosphere-facing side. It will complete a complex set of maneuvers to bleed off speed and ultimately make a controlled landing. In an interview published earlier this month, SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell told Ars she thought it was more likely than not that this orbital flight test would occur in 2021.
Electricity and CRISPR used to write data to bacterial DNA | In recent years, researchers have used DNA to encode everything from an operating system to malware. Rather than being a technological curiosity, these efforts were serious attempts to take advantage of DNA's properties for long-term storage of data. DNA can remain chemically stable for hundreds of thousands of years, and we're unlikely to lose the technology to read it, something you can't say about things like ZIP drives and MO disks. But so far, writing data to DNA has involved converting the data to a sequence of bases on a computer, and then ordering that sequence from someplace that operates a chemical synthesizer—living things don't actually enter into the picture. But separately, a group of researchers had been figuring out how to record biological events by modifying a cell's DNA, allowing them to read out the cell's history. A group at Columbia University has now figured out how to merge the two efforts and write data to DNA using voltage differences applied to living bacteria. CRISPR and data storage The CRISPR system has been developed as a way of editing genes or cutting them out of DNA entirely. But the system first came to the attention of biologists because it inserted new sequences into DNA. For all the details, see our Nobel coverage, but for now, just know that part of the CRISPR system involves identifying DNA from viruses and inserting copies of it into the bacterial genome in order to recognize it should the virus ever appear again. The group at Columbia has figured out how to use this to record memories in bacteria. Let's say you have a process that activates genes in response to a specific chemical, like a sugar. The researchers diverted this to also activate a system that makes copies of a circular piece of DNA called a plasmid. Once the copy number was high, they activated the CRISPR system. Given the circumstances, it was most likely to insert a copy of the plasmid DNA into the genome. When the sugar was not present, it would generally insert something else. Using this system, it was possible to tell whether a bacterium has been exposed to the sugar in its past. It's not perfect, since the CRISPR system doesn't always insert something when you want it to, but it does work on average. So, you just have to sequence enough bacteria in order to figure out the average sequence of events. To adapt this for data storage, the researchers used two plasmids. One is the same as described above: present at low levels when a specific signal is absent, and present at very high levels when the signal's around. The second is always present at moderate levels. When CRISPR is activated, it tended to insert sequences from whichever plasmid was present at higher levels, as shown in the diagram below. On its own, this only stores one bit. But the process can be repeated, creating a stretch of DNA that's a series of inserts derived from the red and blue plasmids, with the identity being determined by whether the signal was present or not. Giving it a jolt It's a neat system but pretty far removed from the sorts of things we normally associate with the production of data—the output of a sensor reading or calculation is rarely a sugar or antibiotic mixed in with a bunch of bacteria. Getting bacteria to respond to an electrical signal turned out to be relatively simple. E. coli is able to alter the activity of genes depending on whether it's in an oxidizing or reducing chemical environment. And the researchers could alter the environment by applying voltage differences to a specific chemical in the culture with the bacteria. More specifically, the voltage difference would alter the oxidative state of a chemical called ferrocyanide. That in turn caused the bacteria to alter the activity of genes. By engineering the plasmid so that it responded to the same signal as these genes, the researchers were able to control the levels of plasmid by applying different voltages. And they could then record that level of that plasmid by activating the CRISPR system in these cells. It's pretty easy to see how each of the inserts in a series could be considered a zero or a one, depending on the identity of the insert. But remember that this system isn't perfect; pretty regularly, CRISPR would insert nothing when it's activated, which would shift all the ensuing bits. As this process is random, the longer the series of bits you try to encode, the more likely it becomes that at least one of them ends up being skipped. To limit this problem, the researchers kept their data to three bits per bacterial population. Even then, they had to train a supervised learning algorithm to reconstruct the most probable series of bits based on an average of the sequences found in the population. And, even with that, the system failed to recognize the series of bits about six percent of the time. In the end, they settled on using a parity bit that was the sum of the first two to allow error correction, and then edited lots of populations in parallel. (By giving each population's plasmids a unique sequence tag called a "barcode," it was possible to mix a lot of them into a single population after the bits were encoded and still untangle everything once the DNA was sequenced.) With everything in place, they successfully stored and read out "Hello world!" They even put the bacteria into some potting soil for a week and showed that they were able to recover the message. (Storing them in the freezer obviously works better.) They estimate that the message can be retained for at least 80 generations of bacteria. Let's be clear: as a storage medium, in its current form, this is pretty terrible. If you wanted to put some data into DNA, you'd be much better off having the DNA chemically synthesized. But it is intriguing to think we could go straight from electrical signals to altered DNA, and there may be some ways to improve the system now that it has been established.
Dire wolves aren’t wolves at all—they form a distinct lineage with jackals | Dire wolves had a burst of newfound fame with their appearance in Game of Thrones, where they were portrayed as a far larger version of more mundane wolves. Here in the real world, only the largest populations of present-day wolves get as large as the dire wolf, which weighed nearly 70 kilograms. These animals once shared North America—and likely prey—with predators like the smilodon, a saber-toothed cat. Prior to the arrival of humans, dire wolves were far more common than regular wolves, as indicated by the remains found in the La Brea tar seeps, where they outnumber gray wolves by a factor of about 100. Like the smilodon and many other large North American mammals, the dire wolf vanished during a period of climate change and the arrival of humans to the continent, even as gray wolves and coyotes survived. And with their departure, they left behind a bit of a mystery: what were they? A new study uses ancient DNA from dire wolf skeletons to determine that they weren't actually wolves and had been genetically isolated from them for millions of years. Looks like a wolf, but... When it comes to canids, species boundaries and their relationship to anatomy are fuzzy. Domesticated dogs have incredibly diverse morphologies yet are all part of one species and can still interbreed with the gray wolves from which they were derived. Gray wolves and coyotes can also interbreed. So the question of whether gray wolves and dire wolves are closely related, as suggested by their similar appearances, would also hint at whether the dire wolf has made genetic contributions to any current species. The new work, done by a large, international collaboration (full disclosure: I've been rock climbing with one of the authors) started with the traditional means of trying to answer this question: by looking at the skeletons of dire wolves. But this analysis, which involved over 700 individual skeletons, didn't produce much. Although they differ by enough that the two species could be consistently identified, there were no dramatic differences that suggest a significant evolutionary distance. So the team turned to more modern methods. It's possible to isolate fragments of collagen, a protein that's a major component of bone and frequently has subtle differences between species. The sequence of dire wolf collagen had enough differences to suggest that dire wolves were distantly related to many other modern dog-like species. But the similarities among all of them were high enough to keep the researchers from resolving the relationships among these species. Next, the team started isolating DNA from remains and managed to obtain some from five samples, originating from across the United States, from Idaho to Tennessee. The skeletons ranged in age from 13,000 to over 50,000 years old. An analysis of the shorter mitochondrial genome produced results similar to collagen. It indicated that dire wolves were a distinct lineage that was distant from that of wolves and coyotes, but the analysis was confused both by small differences between species and the fact that some lineages (like wolves and coyotes) had interbred. A distant relative That left the analysis dependent on the sequence of the regular nuclear genome. Because of the age of the samples, the DNA was very damaged and yielded only a small portion of the animals' full genomes (only from 1 to 20 percent of the genome was obtained, depending on the sample). To fully explore the canid lineage, the researchers also obtained the genome sequence from a North American wolf and two jackals—most other species on this branch of the evolutionary tree had been sequenced. The tree based on these sequences indicate that the last fox species branched off from the rest of the canids about 7 million years ago. The next branch, occurring about 6 million years ago, produced a branch that leads to the dire wolf. Everything else, including jackals, African wild dogs, various wolf species, and the coyote, were all on a separate branch of the lineage and are far more closely related to each other than to the dire wolf. There's a fair amount of uncertainty here, as there typically is in evolutionary sequence analyses; the split between the dire wolf and the other major branch could have occurred anywhere from 4 to over 8 million years ago. But it's clear that, despite their physical similarities, dire wolves are part of a distinct lineage that's only distantly related to dogs. Given that other canid species seem to have engaged in semi-regular interbreeding, the researchers checked for signs of that here. This analysis showed that there was no clear indication that dire wolves had interbred with either wolves or coyotes, despite sharing a continent for many thousands of years. There is a hint of a possibility that dire wolf ancestors had interbred with the ancestor of wolves, coyotes, and dholes somewhere around 3 million years ago, but the signal for this is somewhat weak. Overall, this result is interesting as a fact itself. A couple of generations of Dungeons & Dragons players have probably been told that a dire wolf is a really big wolf, and we now know that's wrong. But it's also likely to cause us to go back and rethink some fossils that we've had for years. We have a number from North America that have been interpreted under the view that all the canids on the continent were part of a closely related cluster of species. Now that we know there were two very distinct lineages here, we can go back and try to determine if any of the older fossils are more closely related to one or the other lineage.
Zodiac Killer cipher is cracked after eluding sleuths for 51 years | A coded message sent by a brutal serial killer who has never been caught has been cracked more than 51 years after it was sent. The male suspect, known as the Zodiac Killer, killed at least five people and attempted to kill at least two more in Northern California in 1968 and 1969. In the first three attacks, he targeted couples. The first two murder victims were high school students who were parked in a car on their first date. In attacks on the other two couples, he managed to kill the women, but the men survived. A male San Francisco cab driver was the last known victim. During the murder spree, the Zodiac Killer sent media outlets a series of letters taking credit for the slayings. To prove the authenticity of the claims, the letters included unreleased details and evidence from the crime scenes. In August 1969, following the murders of three of the five known victims, the Zodiac Killer sent three almost identical letters to three Bay Area newspapers. Each letter also included one-third of a 408-symbol cryptogram that the suspect said would reveal his identity. The killer demanded the papers publish the letters in full or he would kill again. A week after the letters were sent, a couple in Salinas, California, cracked the cipher. The Zodiac Killer, the plaintext revealed, said he was collecting slaves for the afterlife and that he wouldn’t disclose his identity because doing so would interfere with those plans. In November 1969, after killing the remaining two known victims, the Zodiac Killer sent a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle that included a new puzzle. The cryptogram was known as the Z-340, or simply the 340, because it contained 340 characters in it. The full image of the cryptogram appears below: Ever since then, both amateur and professional cryptographers, including those working for the FBI, have worked to crack the cipher. It wasn’t until this week that an international team solved it. “The cipher had been unsolved for so long, it had a huge target on its back, and I felt like it was a challenge that had a chance of being solved,” Dave Oranchak, one of the three men who cracked the encoded message, said by email. “It was an exciting project to work on, and it was on many people’s ‘top unsolved ciphers of all time’ lists.” The full text of the cracked cipher reads: I HOPE YOU ARE HAVING LOTS OF FUN IN TRYING TO CATCH ME THAT WASN’T ME ON THE TV SHOW WHICH BRINGS UP A POINT ABOUT ME I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE GAS CHAMBER BECAUSE IT WILL SEND ME TO PARADICE ALL THE SOONER BECAUSE I NOW HAVE ENOUGH SLAVES TO WORK FOR ME WHERE EVERYONE ELSE HAS NOTHING WHEN THEY REACH PARADICE SO THEY ARE AFRAID OF DEATH I AM NOT AFRAID BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY NEW LIFE WILL BE AN EASY ONE IN PARADICE DEATH The decoded message squares with much of what is already known about the case. The mention of the TV show and gas chambers refers to a call made to a talk show on KGO-TV a month earlier, in which someone claiming to be the Zodiac Killer said: “I need help. I’m sick. I don’t want to go to the gas chamber.” In other communications, the killer used the same misspelling for the word “paradise.” And of course, there were earlier references to collecting slaves for the afterlife. The FBI in San Francisco has since confirmed that the team has correctly solved the cryptogram. In a statement issued on Friday, the agency wrote: The FBI is aware that a cipher attributed to the Zodiac Killer was recently solved by private citizens. The Zodiac Killer case remains an ongoing investigation for the FBI San Francisco division and our local law enforcement partners. The Zodiac Killer terrorized multiple communities across Northern California and even though decades have gone by, we continue to seek justice for the victims of these brutal crimes. Due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, and out of respect for the victims and their families, we will not be providing further comment at this time. Oranchak, a 46-year-old software developer in Virginia, said the 340 is what’s known as a transposition cipher. Most ciphers used today by computers rely on mathematics to scramble messages. Transposition ciphers, by contrast, are largely relics from the past that use rules to rearrange the characters or groups of characters in the message. Transposition ciphers rearrange messages in a wide variety of ways. A common way is by rearranging columns of a message. The message in the 340 was probably rearranged by manipulating triangular sections cut from messages written into rectangles. Oranchak and his colleagues developed an app that helped him and his colleagues unravel the puzzle. In the video below, Oranchak provides a much more detailed explanation of the cipher and how he and his colleagues cracked it. Oranchak said he has been working on and off on solving the 340 since 2006. The other two men on the team are Sam Blake, an applied mathematician who lives in Australia, and Jarl Van Eycke, a warehouse operator in Belgium. Van Eycke is also the software developer behind the AZdecrypt, a code-breaking app that was inspired by his drive to crack the 340.
"Moynihan Train Hall: It’s Stunning. And, a First Step." | "The $1.6 billion Moynihan Train Hall opened at dawn on New Year’s morning — on budget, too, even a couple of months early. Instagram swooned. Tweeters channeled Stefon from “Saturday Night Live.” In the midst of everything else, we needed this. New York needs this. No, the huge, lofty train hall, with its soaring skylights, doesn’t magically resurrect the old Pennsylvania Station or extinguish the raging dumpster fire that is the current one. It leaves all sorts of herculean challenges and tasks around Penn Station unresolved. But it delivers on its promise, giving the city the uplifting gateway it deserves. When was the last time you could say something like that about a public works project? We’ll get to what Moynihan doesn’t do. First: It converts what used to be a mail-sorting hall inside the James A. Farley Building, formerly the General Post Office, across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station. If you can’t picture it, Farley is that Beaux-Arts behemoth with the imperial staircase and Corinthian columns, occupying the entirety of the superblock between Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets. The building was built during the early 1910s as an architectural bookend to McKim, Mead & White’s gloried station. This was a time when post offices and train stations were conceived to be palaces for the people — and when mail was transported by rail. Farley (this is a crucial point) sits over the end of several tracks that serve Penn. The slightly Rube Goldbergian idea of repurposing it as a train hall was first floated nearly 30 years ago by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the United States Senator from New York and the most architecturally engaged and sophisticated public official since Thomas Jefferson. He understood the historic station was a kind of civic barometer. An era had come tumbling down along with the soot-stained travertine walls and Doric columns when wrecking crews razed the original site in 1963. By the ’60s, Gilded Age optimism and New York’s leaping ambition at the start of the century had succumbed to a mean, cramped vision of the city and its prospects, which the new subterranean Penn Station exactly embodied. Senator Moynihan wondered whether Farley’s mail-sorting facility, with its access to railway platforms under Eighth Avenue, was a potential restorative for lost glory that kept things, architecturally speaking, in the family. This being a big, complicated infrastructural proposal, years passed and various attempts to make something happen foundered. Finally in 2016, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo got it done: He promised the train hall would be built and showed renderings by the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which had been working on various conversion schemes since the ’90s. You may have glimpsed Farley’s mail sorting room in “Miracle on 34th Street.” It was a prosaic, not obviously promising thrum and mess of machinery and columns. A skylight had been covered over during World War II. A dropped ceiling hid steel trusses from which security guards kept their eyes on postal employees. The transformation now is stunning. Full credit to the governor for bringing all the key players together. Michael Evans deserves a special shout out. He was president of the Moynihan Station Development Corporation and died, at the age of 40, in March. Mr. Evans, the team at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and the engineering firm Schlaich Bergermann have gifted the city with a new light-filled steel, glass and Tennessee marble cathedral, nearly the size of Grand Central Terminal’s main hall. Those trusses, exposed and painted gray as is much of the hall, support catenary skylights, like inverted nets or inflated glass balloons, aerial feats of sculptural engineering and parametric design. Norman Foster’s Great Court at the British Museum comes to mind (Moynihan’s grid shells are actually finer), as do classic 19th century European railway sheds and of course the concourse from Charles McKim’s original Penn Station. But Moynihan doesn’t pretend to exhume the concourse or compete with Grand Central. The marble recalls the stone quarried for Grand Central. Arched windows allude to the Baths of Caracalla, one of McKim’s inspirations. And as in McKim’s station, a clock dangles above the middle of the train hall, begging to be met under. The architect Peter Pennoyer won a competition to design it. He riffs on Farley’s industrial pedigree along with Ralph T. Walker and Ely Jacques Kahn to concoct a nostalgic, Art Deco confection. I like it. That said, the architecture is modern, sober and solid. The layout is the opposite of the current Penn Station — clear, intuitive, axial, with loads of electronic signage and wayfinding kiosks. We’ll see how it functions once retail settles in. The original station, let’s remember, was built by and belonged to a private, for-profit company. Moynihan, like so many public projects today, depends on retail and commercial development. Facebook recently leased 730,000 square feet in the west end of Farley. Skeptics had expressed fears that the new train hall would be just another publicly subsidized shopping mall masquerading as a railway station like the $4 billion Oculus at the World Trade Center. (I can’t think of a recent project that did more to squander public faith or sour New Yorkers on the value of architecture.) I was worried, myself. But Moynihan isn’t a shopping mall, at least it doesn’t look that way to me. The main hall seems clearly organized around passenger services and amenities. The Rockwell Group designed for it an attractive 320-seat waiting room with snaking walnut banquettes. I suspect there will be a call for even more seating, post-pandemic. The concourse is a place where people might just want to hang out. Public bathrooms are exceptionally nice. The Public Art Fund has contributed first-rate art installations by Kehinde Wiley, Elmgreen & Dragset and Stan Douglas. A midblock corridor, where mail trucks used to disgorge cargo, now leads to Amtrak’s almost comically handsome Acela lounge on a mezzanine overlooking the train hall, by FXCollaborative. As for circulation and access, an escalator and corridor tie the train hall to Ninth Avenue along what would be West 32nd Street. The metamorphosis of the neighborhood to the west of Moynihan into Singapore on the Hudson, with its rash of new office and high-priced apartment towers, including the architectural petting zoo called Hudson Yards, provided a demographic rationale for the train hall. West Side development, even looking ahead several decades, is in fact not likely to account for more than a fraction of Penn’s ridership. Like a luxury box in a stadium, Moynihan was built essentially to benefit a privileged few. What Penn still needs are more tracks and platforms and new tunnels under the Hudson River — a project called Gateway, which, fingers crossed, might at last get funded with an Amtrak fanboy in the White House. The economy of the Eastern Seaboard depends on it, and on increasing Penn Station’s capacity. Before the pandemic, some 650,000 people a day used the station, triple the number it was built to handle. As many as one million or more may want to use it in the coming years, especially assuming Penn Station Access brings all of the city’s major commuter railways, including Metro-North, into the station. This requires that a whole new facility, Penn South, be built south of the existing one, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, to link with Gateway’s tunnels and create new tracks to serve New Jersey Transit riders, whose misery Moynihan does next to nothing to relieve. This is because Farley squats over the westernmost ends of tracks used by Amtrak and Long Island Railroad but over tracks that only partly serve New Jersey Transit. Moynihan is a spectacular train hall for Amtrak, providing additional access to Long Island Railroad platforms. But Amtrak accounts for some 30,000 passengers a day. Five percent of Penn Station’s (pre-Covid-19) ridership. I still believe the hall is a useful step. Symbols matter, after all, as the original Penn Station proves. The millions of commuters who suffer the present station know that its problems aren’t just aesthetic. They involve public health, public safety, environmental justice and the city’s economy, which in no small measure will only recover if commuters in places like Floral Park, Hempstead and Trenton want to return to offices in Hudson Yards, Midtown and Brooklyn after the pandemic. Moynihan provides a welcoming new front door and doubles down on the future of train travel. It sends a message. And we shouldn’t underestimate the hunger and political momentum it can generate for further improvements. Momentum is our collective challenge. We have become a city of naysayers and obstructionists. But historically, New York has battled back after recessions and calamities by dreaming big. The success of Moynihan must accelerate a campaign that includes Penn South, a renovated Penn Station, Gateway — all of it part of a neighborhood plan that rationalizes forthcoming development, adds bike access and prioritizes public spaces, street life and pedestrians. Governor Cuomo has said he intends to follow through. On Sunday he proposed a $60 million plan for walking paths that would link Moynihan to an extension of the High Line and Hudson River Park. Talk is talk, obviously. Moynihan is something else. It’s proof of concept. Last week representatives for Manhattan Community Board 5, which oversees the neighborhood, agreed to consider a proposal by PAU Studio, an architectural and urban design firm, that would move Madison Square Garden across Seventh Avenue, freeing Pennsylvania Station from its entombment. An intriguing, less costly and far likelier idea just now making the rounds involves persuading (a presently recalcitrant) Amtrak to relinquish its mezzanine space in Penn, since it has Moynihan. Demolishing that mezzanine could make it possible to raise the low ceiling now squashing the rest of the station into a subbasement, giving millions some relief. Getting Amtrak (much less Madison Square Garden) to go along with either plan is another matter. Penn Station has been notoriously impossible to fix because it is the perfect storm of siloed interests, private properties, entrenched bureaucracies and conflicting jurisdictions. London may provide a useful example here. King’s Cross and St. Pancras are neighboring but separate railway stations in the city’s King’s Cross district. One station serves commuters and points north, the other European travelers as well. For generations, the area was poor, run-down and crime-ridden. Its problems seemed intractable. Then the stations were redone and the neighborhood redeveloped. The process was costly and took many years. But now the district is one of Europe’s great success stories, a thriving hub, critical to England’s economy and future. Change can happen. Moynihan is a start. "
Tommy Lasorda’s Death Starts a Conversation About His Son | "When Penelope Spheeris heard that Tommy Lasorda died on Thursday at 93, she knew many people would be touched by the sad news, particularly in Los Angeles. The city has long been her home, and it is also where Lasorda became a baseball icon, leading the Dodgers to two World Series titles during his Hall of Fame career. But Spheeris’s mind quickly turned to someone else in the Lasorda family that she had known and missed: his son, Tommy Jr., known as Spunky, who was gay and died in 1991 at 33 from complications from AIDS. She cried. “I always felt that it should be more public that Sr. had a son that was gay and gorgeous and everything that Tommy was,” she said in a phone interview on Saturday. “He was a very, very memorable person.” There is much to remember about Tommy Lasorda Sr.’s long life in the public eye: his outsized personality, his profane humor, his success leading teams, his decorated career, his charitable side and his burning love of the Dodgers. In recent days, others have also been discussing and learning about another part of Lasorda’s story — his relationship with his son — and what it said about society and baseball culture at the time. “My son wasn’t gay,” Lasorda told Peter Richmond, who wrote about the duo’s complicated relationship for GQ magazine in 1992, in some of his few public comments about his son. “No way,” he continued, with some expletives sprinkled in. “No way. I read that in a paper. I also read in that paper that a lady gave birth to a monkey, too. That’s not the truth.” Lasorda also rankled at reports that his son was an AIDS patient. He told Richmond, “I don’t care what people … I know what my son died of. I know what he died of. The doctor put out a report of how he died. He died of pneumonia.” In a recent commentary piece for the Los Angeles Blade, Karen Ocamb, a former news editor for the publication, claimed that Lasorda had once acknowledged at a charity event that his son was gay and that he had died of AIDS. Lasorda’s family did not respond to a request from The New York Times seeking comment. Spheeris, 75, was glad more people were talking about Tommy Jr. because the topic was more hush-hush at the time. She said Tommy Jr. didn’t want people talking about his sexuality either, because he wanted to protect his father’s wishes. She found that sad but said Tommy Jr. did not resent his father over it. Spheeris, a director who made such films as “Wayne’s World” and “Suburbia,” got to know Tommy Jr. in Los Angeles in the 1980s. They met at a punk rock club. “I remember really clearly the moment I first saw him: He was sitting alone on the edge of a sofa and everybody in there was like all punk and they were all dressed in black, but he was wearing a white suit,” she said. “I know it sounds weird, but he had kind of a glow around him.” They became fast friends, hanging out at his apartment in West Hollywood or in the nearby clubs. She called him a sweet, gentle and loving person with an impeccable sense of style. She said one reason she related so much to him was because her own brother, who was killed by a drunken driver in 1984, was gay, and many of his friends died of AIDS complications because the medical treatments were not as advanced as they are now. Spheeris said Tommy Jr. and his father loved each other. Tommy Jr. would be excited to meet his father for a meal or at Dodger Stadium, where he would sit in the dugout before games. “He told me he liked going because he could flirt with the guys,” she said, laughing. “But he could never say that to his dad obviously.” She added later: “I don’t want to be mad at Tommy Lasorda Sr. I don’t want to be mad at somebody who just passed away and somebody that everybody loves. What I’m going to be mad at is the culture that allows that kind of thinking. That’s what I don’t like. Could you imagine? It was such a struggle between the two of them to try and balance keeping Sr.’s. legacy and career on track while having a gay son in such an environment where people just have no tolerance for gay people.” While his father was the Dodgers’ manager, Tommy Jr. befriended Glenn Burke, an outfielder on the team, which strained Burke’s relationship with his boss. Burke is the first player in Major League Baseball history to come out to his teammates during his playing career. He came out publicly in 1982. Al Campanis, the Dodgers’ general manager at the time, offered Burke bonus money if he married — something he later said was not a bribe but because the Dodgers encouraged family stability and maturity on their roster. (Campanis was fired in 1987 for racist comments he made about Black people in a television interview.) Burke, who was Black, turned down the offer. Burke was traded to the Oakland Athletics in May 1978, an unpopular move in the Dodgers clubhouse. Two of Burke’s teammates, Davey Lopes and Dusty Baker, later said Burke was traded because he was gay. In the 2010 documentary “Out: The Glenn Burke Story,” his former Athletics teammate Claudell Washington said Manager Billy Martin introduced Burke to his new team with a homophobic slur. Since then, a few more players, umpires and officials have come out. The most prominent: Billy Bean, who became M.L.B.’s first ambassador of inclusion after his playing days. Still, in recent years, several players, like Kevin Pillar and Yunel Escobar, and the broadcaster Thom Brennaman had to apologize for their use of homophobic slurs. But baseball’s culture has progressed since Lasorda’s days, said Dave Pallone, a former M.L.B. umpire who said he was fired in 1988 for being gay. He came out publicly soon after and wrote a book titled “Behind the Mask: My Double Life in Baseball.” He said attitudes in the sport slowly began changing as more people come out publicly. “Hopefully that helped to move the tide along and maybe baseball culture will get better,” Pallone said. “And with the younger people playing in the game, and younger people in management, that the game will change as far as openness toward the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and it won’t be so tough for fathers and mothers who are part of the game of baseball to accept their sons and daughters.” Pallone, 69, said this in a phone interview on Friday evening, the day after Lasorda died of sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Pallone considered Lasorda a friend and mourned his loss. He had fond memories of their time together during and after their on-field days; Lasorda came on Pallone’s radio show once and told him that he should never have lost his umpiring job. Pallone, though, said he never talked to Lasorda about his coming out in 1990. Nor did he ever speak to Lasorda about his son after Tommy Jr.’s death. Pallone, who used to see Tommy Jr. at games, didn’t feel like it was his place to broach the subject. “There was no question that he had a difficult time with it,” Pallone said about Lasorda. “But on the other side of that coin, Tommy was very generous person outside of the baseball field. We had our differences on the field, but he was also fair. He was generous off the field. If he could help you with something, he would do it. So you try to look at the whole picture, especially then when I was a closeted gay man. Even though I knew in my heart what was going on, I also wanted to try, just like I do now, and look at the whole person.” Pallone said that although Lasorda’s public comments about his son were horrible, he attributed Lasorda’s attitude to, among other things, a macho culture, a generational gap, a Catholic background “and him being Italian, like my father was Italian.” He added, “It’s a hard thing to accept a son’s sexual orientation when it isn’t what you’re used to.” When Tommy Jr. died, Lasorda, his wife and their daughter were at his side, a family spokesman told The Los Angeles Times at the time. Lasorda was absent from the team for three days. He later told GQ that he cried a lot about his son’s death but never around the team. “I had him for 33 years,” Lasorda told the magazine. “Thirty-three years is better than nothing, isn’t it? If I could have seen God, and God said to me, ‘I’m going to give you a son for 33 years and take him away after 33 years,’ I’d have said, ‘Give him to me.’” Pallone said he believed Lasorda funneled his grief into his charitable work, often geared toward helping youth. In 1997, Lasorda and his wife donated $500,000 through the Thomas Lasorda Jr. Memorial Foundation to maintain a public gym in Yorba Linda, Calif., not far from where they lived. The facility was renamed the Thomas Lasorda Jr. Field House. Pallone, who became a motivational speaker giving presentations on diversity to companies, schools and teams, said he had brought up Lasorda’s story in his talks. “The story is that you don’t close doors on your family,” Pallone said. “You just can’t close doors, period, because you never know how it’s going to hurt you. And that’s what happened with Tommy.” "
"On Factory Floors, a Chime and Flashing Light to Maintain Distance" | "BERLIN — The 2019-20 National Basketball Association season was suspended for over 140 days after a player tested positive for the coronavirus. But once play resumed in late July, no other players tested positive. The league was able to evade the virus by requiring teams to live and play their games in an isolated area known as the Bubble, at the closed Disney World resort in Florida. But a small piece of technology also played a role: a wristband that players, coaches and trainers could wear off the court, and that was required for reporters covering the teams. A tiny digital chip in the band enforces social distancing by issuing a warning — by light and sound — when wearers get too close to one another for too long off. The bands have been picked up by the National Football League, the Pacific-12 college football conference and other sports leagues around the world. The Munich start-up behind the N.B.A.’s wristbands, Kinexon, is happy with the publicity of helping prevent top athletes from catching the virus, even as such devices raise privacy concerns. Now it is looking toward broader arenas: factory production lines, warehouses and logistics centers where millions of people continue to work despite the pandemic. One of the companies working with Kinexon is Henkel, a global industrial and household chemical manufacturer based in Germany. When the coronavirus infected about a dozen workers in Henkel’s plant in Serbia last spring, the two-week shutdown that followed cost millions of dollars in lost revenue, said Wolfgang Weber, a senior manager for Henkel. Henkel was already testing an earlier version of Kinexon’s wearable tech, designed to avert collisions between forklifts and workers on high-traffic factory floors. The system’s sensors would automatically stop a forklift if it got too close to a worker. After the outbreak at the Serbian plant and within weeks of the first wave of pandemic lockdowns, Kinexon offered Henkel a chance to test a variation of that technology, called SafeZone. Its half-ounce sensor, worn on the wrist like a watch or around the neck on a lanyard or on a badge, makes a chime and flashes when another sensor is within a prescribed distance for a set period. Henkel agreed to give it a try. Testing the devices in real life was important to Kinexon. “What’s important in this is not only to have the technology working in a lab — what’s important now is to be able to bring the technology to where people need it,” said Oliver Trinchera, who co-founded Kinexon in 2012 and is one of its directors, “be it on the factory floor or on the sports pitch.” Henkel tested the system on the entire staff of its plant in Raciborz, Poland, a big facility on the southern outskirts of a medieval coal town, where 250 people work three shifts a day making and packaging powdered and liquid detergent for Central Europe. The sensors were programmed to go off when two people were within 1.5 meters, roughly six feet, of each other for more than five seconds. The sensors measure distance using ultra-broadband signals, which Kinexon says are more accurate and use far less energy than Bluetooth signals, the other technology often found in coronavirus tracing apps. Mirella Zielinska, who has worked at the Raciborz plant for five years, said she had quickly gotten used to wearing the device on her wrist. In a fast-moving production line where one of the duties is packing detergent, it reminded her to keep her distance, she said. “At first we were maybe a bit worried, but it seems so normal now,” Ms. Zielinska said in a Skype interview while sitting in an office at the plant. That’s not to say the unexpected doesn’t sometimes happen. The sensor detects distances through bathroom stall dividers, for example, triggering the alarm at unwelcome times. And during the interview, a colleague of Ms. Zielinska’s poked his head into the office, wondering what she was doing. Before she could answer, both beepers had gone off. The workers wear the sensors throughout their shift, reminding them to keep their distance even during lunch in the canteens. Adrian Wycisk, the plant’s manager, compared the sensors’ chimes to the alert in cars when people haven’t put on their seatbelts. “It ultimately changes the behavior in drivers,” he said, adding that he has seen a marked improvement in workers’ keeping a safe distance. The system stores, for several weeks, information on when a worker was near other workers — a potentially useful tool for tracing interactions if a worker becomes infected, but one that raises worries about management’s keeping tabs on a worker’s movements all shift long. Henkel said that it gave only a small number of senior managers access to the data, and that the company had distributed pamphlets explaining to workers that the badges would never be used to track their movements. The data records which employees interacted, not where the interaction took place. Mr. Wycisk said Henkel had vowed to retrieve the information only if a coronavirus infection needed to be traced. The German union that represents Henkel workers declined to comment about the technology. In the long run, the technology could also help Henkel reconfigure some of its production procedures to avoid close contact, Mr. Weber said. Kinexon has sold the technology to a number of well-known German manufacturing and cargo companies — the tire maker Continental and the logistics giant DB Schenker were early adopters. Kinexon said it has worked with American companies, but that it was contractually obligated not to release their names.  Overall, the company said it is supplying the technology to over 200 companies worldwide. It estimates its badges have prevented 1.5 million contacts a day, a difficult number to confirm. The sensors are priced between $100 and $200 each. The six-week test in Raciborz, during which no worker tested positive, persuaded Henkel to roll out the technology in its cleaning-chemicals production sites over the next year. How many of the company’s 52,000 employees worldwide ultimately wear the technology depends on how long the pandemic continues. If the vaccines are successful and the pandemic is overcome sometime this year, Mr. Weber said, he plans to the reuse the sensors for their original intent: to avoid collisions between workers and forklifts. The fact that such plans would require fewer badges than Henkel acquiring is not a concern. “I would still say that it is a success,” he said. "
Covid-19 Took a Bite From U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2020 | "WASHINGTON — America’s greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry plummeted more than 10 percent in 2020, reaching their lowest levels in at least three decades as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the nation’s economy, according to an estimate published Tuesday by the Rhodium Group. The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country’s power plants, factories, cars and trucks. “The most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels,” said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, a research and consulting firm. “But as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we’d expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.” Before the pandemic hit, America’s emissions had been slowly but steadily declining since 2005, in large part because utilities that generate electricity have been shifting away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, in favor of cheaper and cleaner natural gas, wind and solar power. Over the past decade, utilities have retired hundreds of coal-burning power plants despite President Trump’s efforts to revive the industry. Then, the coronavirus arrived. As governors placed their states under lockdown last spring and Americans sheltered in place, emissions started plunging across parts of the economy that had rarely seen sustained drops before. Transportation, the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gases, saw a 14.7 percent decline in emissions in 2020 as millions of people stopped driving to work and airlines canceled flights. While travel started picking up again in the latter half of the year as states relaxed their lockdowns, Americans drove 15 percent fewer miles over all last year than they did in 2019 and the demand for jet fuel fell by more than one-third. Emissions from heavy industry, such as steel and cement, dropped 7 percent in 2020 as automakers and other manufacturers churned out fewer goods amid the economic slump. America’s buildings, which produce carbon dioxide when they burn oil or natural gas for heat, saw emissions fall 6.2 percent, driven by both lockdowns and warmer-than-average weather. In the electricity sector, emissions plunged by 10.3 percent in 2020, driven by a sharp decline in coal burning. As electricity demand sagged nationwide, utilities ran their coal plants far less often because coal has become the most expensive fuel in many parts of the country. Instead, they used more natural gas — which produces less carbon dioxide than coal, but still generates significant heat-trapping methane — and drew more heavily on emissions-free wind and solar power. Renewable energy surged in 2020, as energy companies overcame disruptions from the pandemic to build a record number of new wind turbines and solar panels ahead of a key deadline to claim a federal tax credit. The United States produced roughly as much electricity from renewable sources last year as it did from coal, a milestone that has never been reached before. Over all, the fall in emissions nationwide was the largest one-year decline since at least World War II, the Rhodium Group said, and put the United States within striking distance of one of its major climate goals under the Paris agreement, a global pact by nearly 200 governments to address climate change. As part of that agreement, former President Barack Obama had pledged that United States emissions would fall 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. President Trump disavowed the Paris pact, and, before last year, it looked like the United States would miss that target. But in the wake of the pandemic, America’s industrial emissions are now roughly 21.5 percent below 2005 levels. But that milestone comes with several caveats. First, those numbers don’t account for any uptick in emissions resulting from last year’s record-setting wildfires in the West, which burned millions of acres of forests and grasslands, sending the carbon dioxide locked away in all those trees into the atmosphere. One preliminary estimate in November from BloombergNEF suggested that wildfires could offset roughly 3 percent of last year’s drop in American emissions from energy and industry. While many trees that went up in flames will eventually grow back, absorbing carbon dioxide as they do, that process will take years. And scientists have warned that wildfires will become larger and more frequent as the planet warms. The other caveat is that America’s emissions could tick back up again once vaccines are widely distributed and the economy recovers. The Rhodium Group report noted that a similar rebound occurred after the financial crisis of 2008-9 caused emissions to fall sharply. And it noted that many sectors, like air travel and steel making, have already been rebounding in recent months. “Unfortunately, 2020 tells us little about what we can expect to see in 2021 and beyond,” the report concluded. “The vast majority of 2020’s emission reductions were due to decreased economic activity and not from any structural changes that would deliver lasting reductions in the carbon intensity of our economy.” Scientists warn that even a big one-year drop in emissions is not enough to stop global warming. Until humanity’s emissions are essentially zeroed out and nations are no longer adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the planet will continue to heat up. As if to underscore that warning, European researchers announced last week that 2020 was quite likely tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has called global warming a top priority, setting a goal of slashing America’s emissions to net zero by 2050. Doing so, experts said, would require major new steps to accelerate the use of renewable electricity, shift Americans from gasoline-burning cars to cleaner electric models and rethink methods for processes like home heating or steel and cement production. And those efforts would need to be replicated across the globe. On Monday, the International Energy Agency said it would publish a detailed blueprint in May for how the global economy could reach net-zero emissions by 2050, noting that the worldwide drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year was likely to prove temporary unless nations took the opportunity to rethink their reliance on fossil fuels. “Nothing short of a total transformation of our energy infrastructure will be required,” said Fatih Birol, the agency’s executive director. “That calls for decisive action this year, next year and indeed every year to 2050.” "
"To Start a New Habit, Make It Easy" | "Whether your goal for the new year is to lose weight, start exercising or focus on self-care, ask yourself: How can I make this easier? In the scientific study of habit formation, the thing that makes it harder for you to achieve your goal is called friction. Reducing friction means removing an obstacle or coming up with a strategy that makes a task easier to do. And if you figure out how to make a goal easier, you’re more likely to succeed. Friction typically comes in three forms — distance, time and effort. For instance, living far from the gym or a favorite walking trail makes it less likely that you’ll go. (One study found that people who lived 5.1 miles from the gym went only once a month, but those who lived within 3.7 miles went five times a month or more.) Time constraints can also get in the way of new healthy habits. If you don’t have much free time, it’s harder to start meditating or working out. And if something requires a lot of effort — like healthful cooking in a disorganized kitchen — you’re less likely to do it. Sometimes adding friction to your life helps you achieve a goal. In one study, slowing down elevator doors by 26 seconds prompted more people to take the stairs. Removing vending machines from schools makes it harder for teens to snack on junk food or drink sugary soda. “The friction you set up or remove in the environment is going to have an effect long after you’ve gotten discouraged and are less excited about the new behavior,” said Wendy Wood, a research psychologist at the University of Southern California and author of “Good Habits, Bad Habits.” “That’s why friction is so powerful. It persists.” Pandemic life has altered many of our routines — so friction that used to be there may have disappeared, and new challenges may have added new friction. For instance, some people no longer commute to work, giving them more time to do other things. While online schooling has made life tough on many parents, families also may have fewer extracurricular obligations, making it easier to have dinner at home. To identify the friction that may be stopping you from achieving your goals, take a moment to think about the time, distance and effort the goal requires. “Ask yourself, ‘What would make it easier for me to do this?’” said Dr. Wood. “You want to reduce the effort. The thing about friction is we often don’t focus on it when we’re changing our behavior. We focus on ourselves and keeping ourselves motivated and exerting willpower. But you have to recognize that you’re also going to be influenced by the things going on around you.” For today’s final Well Challenge, try to make a new habit a little easier with these friction-busting ideas. Everybody has different goals for better health. Here are several different ways you can create a new health habit with less effort. Choose one or several to try or come up with your own easy health resolution. Sleep in your workout clothes. If you’re trying to start a morning exercise routine, make it easy to get dressed for a morning run or workout. Sleep in some or all of your workout clothes. Put your shoes and socks by the bed. It’s one less obstacle to slow you down in the morning. Put hand weights by your desk. Keep light hand weights nearby and do some reps while you’re on a conference call. Hang hooks by your door. Whether you’re always losing your keys or forgetting your mask, creating a station of hooks or shelves by the door for masks, keys or any other essentials you need when you leave the house will help you make mask-wearing a habit. Put extra masks in your coat pockets. I bought a pack of disposable masks and always have a half-dozen stuffed in the pockets of my coats. You never know when you might drop a mask on the ground, decide you want to double mask or offer a mask to someone in need. Over the summer my daughter rode a bike to meet me for an outdoor dinner and her mask blew away. She knew I’d have a replacement handy. Stand on one leg while brushing your teeth. Standing on one leg while brushing your teeth is a way to practice balance. (Change legs after a minute of brushing.) Or use tooth-brushing time to practice mindfulness. You can find a tooth-brushing meditation here. When you add a new habit (like meditation or a balance exercise) to an old habit (like brushing your teeth) it’s called “stacking.” Stacking your habits makes them easier to remember. Buy kitchen tongs. You’ll be amazed how much easier it is to cook, toss a salad or serve noodles with the right set of tongs. In general, having the right gadgets for your kitchen is a way to make cooking easier, and easy is good. Read “These Are the Only Kitchen Tools You’ll Need,” from Julia Moskin, or check out Wirecutter’s advice for the best kitchen tools. Organize your refrigerator. Often the tipping point in a kitchen is the refrigerator. When your fridge is a mess, it’s hard to know what you have available to cook, what food might spoil soon and what you need from the store. Wirecutter has the best fridge organization advice from Marguerite Preston, a former pastry chef, who knows how professional chefs organize a kitchen. “In restaurants, organization is important not only because it helps cooks move quickly and smoothly, but also because wasted food is wasted money,” she writes. “The same is true at home. You may not see the effects of a chaotic fridge in a bad Yelp review or a balance sheet, but they will show in the time it takes to cook dinner and the stress involved.” Watch the jellyfish. One of the best mindfulness tips I came across this year was from Cord Jefferson, the television writer who thanked his therapist on national television when he won an Emmy. Mr. Jefferson told me he struggled with traditional meditation, but he enjoys watching the feed from a web camera showing the jellyfish at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Bookmark the jelly-cam on your phone or laptop browser and get lost in the jellyfish for a short mindfulness break during your workday. Do the Standing 7-Minute Workout. All you need is a wall and a chair nearby for balance. You don’t even have to change your clothes. Our new workout video is a friction-busting workout for anyone who avoids exercise because it’s hard to get up from the floor after a push-up, plank or situps. Complete a 1-minute task. One of my favorite health tips for dealing with stress is the one-minute rule. It comes from Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before,” a book about forming new habits. This simple advice helps you decide what to tackle on a long to-do list. Just do the one-minute tasks first. Hang up a coat. Read some emails. Clear and wipe the kitchen counter. Tidy a book shelf. Whenever you take on a one-minute task, you’ll get a sense of accomplishment and quick boost of happiness. Do a five-finger meditation. This is an easy way to calm yourself, no matter where you are. (I tried it in a dentist chair, and it worked for me!) Start by holding your hand in front of you, fingers spread. Using your index finger on the other hand, start tracing the outline of your hand. Trace up your pinkie, and down. Trace up your ring finger and down. As you do this, breathe in as you trace up, and out as you trace down. Continue finger by finger until you’ve traced your entire hand. Now reverse the process and trace from your thumb back to your pinkie, making sure to inhale as you trace up, and exhale as you trace down. You can find more tips for beating stress in my story, “Peak Anxiety? Here Are 10 Ways to Calm Down.” Create a Sunday basket. I learned this tip from Lisa Woodruff, author of “The Paper Solution.” She suggests dumping your bills, receipts and various papers into a basket. (She sells a product for this, but I just use a regular basket.) Once a week, sort your actionable papers (those that need attention) from your archive papers (those that can be filed.) The Sunday basket approach (she claims it will add five extra hours to your week) is part of a larger system proposed by Ms. Woodruff that uses three-ring binders rather than a filing cabinet. (She suggests five binders for financial information, medical needs, household reference, school items and daily operations.) For me, the Sunday basket is enough, but if you feel chronically overwhelmed by paper, you can learn more on the Organize365.com website. Buy partially prepared food. Buying chopped up food and meal kits costs more, but it does save time. “I always used to avoid buying cut fruits and vegetables in the grocery store, but I found I actually use them sooner, so in the end it kind of pays off,” said Dr. Wood. Keep a tip jar. Tipping in person (rather than by credit card) is an easy way to add a gratitude practice to a delivery day. Pandemic life has meant a lot more deliveries to my door, but I never had cash, so I usually just added the tip to the card. I decided to create the tip jar and make an effort to tip in cash. What I didn’t anticipate is that I would get so much more enjoyment out of tipping in person. (I always wash my hands first, wear a mask at the door and keep it brief.) Put a notebook and pen by your bed. Keeping pen and paper by your bedside allows you to do a nightly stress-dump of all the things on your mind that might otherwise keep you up at night. You get a head start on tomorrow by creating a to-do list. And you can end your day with a simple gratitude practice — writing down three things for which you are grateful. Create a device charging station outside your bedroom. The blue light in your screen has the same effect on your brain as sunlight, which means it wakes you up just when you want to be drifting off. If you’re trying to cut back on screens at bedtime, add some friction by setting up a charging station in your work area, the kitchen — anywhere but your bedroom. “If it’s in the bedroom, it’s easier to use,” said Dr. Wood. “That’s part of the temptation of always staying online. Keep devices out of the bedroom.” "
Who Said Art Is Only for the One Percent? | "Somewhere around the fall of 1967, a couple of new-minted Ph.D.’s, feeding six kids on an income of something like $9,000, set out to decorate their modest house. They brought home a wall-filling banner by the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, which had a dotty seascape cut into its cloth. And a tabletop set of “soft” drums made of canvas, by his colleague-in-Pop Claes Oldenburg. Also, a colorful set of abstractions: Squares within squares by Josef Albers of the Bauhaus. Those Ph.D.’s were my parents, and I’m pretty sure my career as a critic has its roots in that art — art that we’d never have lived with but for an outfit called Multiples, Inc. During its decade-long heyday, in a space on Madison Avenue in New York, the company made and sold new kinds of art that invited something close to mass production, allowing prices that even some young academics could manage. Multiples, Inc., first opened its doors 55 years ago this winter. On Jan. 12, that birth is being celebrated in a show at the New York gallery of Marian Goodman, now one of the world’s leading dealers but first known as a founder of Multiples. The company was born in a spirit “close to the socialist idea that art should be accessible,” Ms. Goodman recalled a few years ago. She and her partners “felt that if young people could buy something really beautiful it could change the audience — an audience that had become elitist because the art was so expensive.” The high-end, high-octane market for contemporary art that we now take for granted had arisen less than a decade before Multiples, Inc., and in 1965 it could still seem a dubious development; a less exclusive and exclusionary alternative had instant appeal. “Artists who questioned the status of art as a luxury commodity embraced multiples as a more democratic art form,” reads a wall text at the Museum of Modern Art, whose recent expansion has made room for an entire gallery dedicated to “The Art of the Multiple.” Early on, the goal was to replace the handmade expressionism of the 1950s with work that explored the materials and mass production of the space age. For her very first multiples, Ms. Goodman got artists to work with sleek, industrial Plexiglas; even if those pieces only got released in a few dozen copies, that could be enough to make them close kin, conceptually, to plastic goods produced by the million. A brooch by Lichtenstein, bearing a woman’s face in his trademark spotty style, was actually issued by Multiples, Inc., at a price of just $25. Working with industrial goods made by others, by 1967 the company was offering up stacks of mirrored glass by Robert Smithson, the land art pioneer and, in 1968, space-shaping lengths of cord by the conceptual sculptor Fred Sandback. Within less than a decade, however, Multiples, Inc., had begun to lose steam. Its most ambitious projects had often lost money: The popular Pop ones, like Oldenburg’s drums or the Lichtenstein pin, cost at least as much to make as they sold for. By the ’80s, when Multiples was mostly reduced to publishing prints, the serious art market was becoming utterly driven by “top prices for unique works,” according to the Swiss curator Dieter Schwarz, who organized the Multiples show at Goodman. That market had — and has — mostly written off the middle-class clients that Multiples, Inc. was founded for. That hasn’t meant the absolute death of art produced in editions. Fine prints have always existed. Museum gift shops and certain galleries still offer modestly priced objects by artists as famous as Damien Hirst or Jeff Koons. But few of those objects carry the charge — aesthetic or social — that multiples did in the ’60s. Instead of commenting on our commercial culture, they can seem fully complicit with it. In 2012, the great curator Germano Celant, who died last year of Covid-19, closed a major essay on multiples by decrying the way they had lost their ideals, turning instead “into a sort of second or third fashion line of art.” At worst, a 21st-century multiple can be like the $5,000 road bike that a billionaire buys with pocket change, to go with the $500,000 Ferrari. More substantial multiples do still get made, in the full Goodman tradition, mostly as fund-raisers for innumerable good causes. Last year, the California Institute of the Arts near Los Angeles announced that it would be celebrating its 50th birthday, in 2021, by getting 50 impressive alumni to conceive multiples for CalArts to sell. Multiples have retained just enough of their “provocative and disorienting message,” as Celant’s essay put it, to make them a good fit for today’s progressive causes. But hived off into this separate, do-gooder corner, the multiple has lost some of the impact it had when it truly went head-to-head with the art world’s one-offs. Joseph Beuys, icon of Germany’s postwar avant-garde, billed his 600 multiples — including his famous felt suit — as central to the spread of his ideas about art, functioning like “an antenna which is standing somewhere and with which one stays in touch,” as he put it. Only a few multiplists have similar ambitions today. Tacita Dean, a leading British artist now based in Berlin, has always been a market contrarian: The slow-burn films that made her famous are only sold as reels of actual, archaic film. So, over the last nine months, her idea of “productive” time spent in lockdown included forging the signature of Christian Dotremont, a long-dead Belgian surrealist, on 100 facsimiles of a postcard he once sent. She ordered 100 letterpress copies of a business card once handed out by the abstractionist Piet Mondrian, then hand-corrected the address on each one to match a penciled correction on the prototype. For another multiple, she stamped the words “Stamp Out Stamping” onto 100 vintage index cards — once on the first card, twice on the second and so on until the last card was just about stamped out with stampings. Her pandemic total came to 50 different eccentric multiples, each remade 100 times, for a just-finished portfolio titled “Monet Hates Me.” (The title comes from Ms. Dean’s discovery of a scrap of French script by Claude Monet that seemed to spell out “hate Tacita.” It was one of several modest objects that the artist dug out during a year she spent in the archives of the Getty Research Institute in California; they became the sources for her pandemic multiples.) Ms. Dean hopes to have the whole box of goods priced at something like 150 euros (about $184) per object, with all 50 adding up to less than she might normally get for a single photo or drawing. Or about what my parents paid, in inflation-adjusted dollars, for their Lichtenstein banner. “I knew that I was sabotaging myself by working on something that would make me zero money,” she said in a recent phone interview. But her goal was to put an entire “exhibition in a box” within reach of the most modest museums and libraries — or households. Ms. Dean speaks of her pandemic project as “anti-fetishized,” and of its clear roots in the democratized multiples of Multiples, Inc. Those origins are even clearer in one of the most notable multiples of recent times, by the Danish artist Danh Vo. (He’s best known for his full-scale copy of the Statue of Liberty, shown in 250 separate parts.) Twelve years ago, Mr. Vo discovered a touching 1861 letter by a French missionary to his father, written in Vietnam as the priest awaited execution by the country’s anti-Catholic regime. Mr. Vo took that letter and had his own immigrant father copy it out in the fancy script he’d learned as a child in Vietnam. The two men then offered it for sale for 300 euros, or roughly $369 today, in as many handmade copies as the world wanted. Mr. Vo figures that, by now, his father has written out the letter almost 2,000 times. “If I contributed anything in the arts, it’s with this work,” said Mr. Vo on a call from his home outside Berlin, adding, “I even tell collectors, ‘Why would you buy anything else?’” The admittedly cryptic piece touches on faith and identity, artistic and manual labor, immigration and assimilation, East and West, colonized and colonizer. Mr. Vo sees the letter’s almost trivial price tag as adding conceptual heft to the piece. He laughs about copies of it that have come up in auctions, given that a new one can always be ordered for the original price — which, with inflation, actually amounts to a steady decline in real cost. “I wanted my best work to be the cheapest work,” said Mr. Vo. That’s a perfectly sensible statement that only seems strange because, in the years since the high-end market eclipsed Multiples, Inc., we’ve come to think that the best art always bears the biggest price tag.

These Snakes Found a New Way to Slither | "In 2016, on the northern tip of Guam, two biologists, Tom Seibert and Julie Savidge, challenged several brown tree snakes to a battle of wits. The arena: a concrete pen with a narrow metal pole. The prize, at the top of the pole: two mice, a seed cake and a potato in a cage. (The potato and seed cake were for the mice.) The obstacle: a three-foot-tall metal stovepipe baffle cinched around the pole like a cummerbund. The biologists wanted to see if the baffle could protect nest boxes designed for Guam’s population of Micronesian starlings, which has been decimated since brown tree snakes were introduced in the late 1940s. But while the scientists were sleeping, the nocturnal snake managed to wiggle up the pole, wrap its noodling body around the baffle almost like a lasso, and inch its way up toward the mice. Although the snake’s strategy of ascent has troubling implications for the conservation of the Micronesian starling, it also reveals an entirely new mode of snake locomotion that has never been described before. The researchers describe this new “lasso locomotion” in a study published Monday in Biology Letters. Dr. Seibert, a professor emeritus at Colorado State University, and his colleague Martin Kastner, also a biologist, made the discovery while reviewing time-lapsed infrared footage of the snake pit. The footage was initially boring, showing the snakes nosing around the bottom of the baffle but unable to climb it. Suddenly, several hours into the footage, one snake wrapped its body around the baffle, grabbed the end of its body with its tail, and wiggled its way up. “We were bamboozled by what we were seeing,” Dr. Seibert said, adding that he and Mr. Kastner kept replaying the video. “Snakes just don’t move this way.” Dr. Seibert asked Bjorn Lardner, a herpetologist who studies brown tree snakes on Guam, to see if he could figure out what the snakes were doing, but Dr. Lardner was stumped. Dr. Seibert sent the video to Dr. Savidge, also a professor emeritus at Colorado State University, to see if she had any idea. Dr. Savidge, who has studied these snakes for 30 years, was stumped. In 2018, the researchers sent the video to Bruce Jayne, a snake locomotion biologist at the University of Cincinnati. “It was a real mind-bender,” said Dr. Jayne, who is an author on the paper. “It just loops around the cylinder and then magically wiggles up.” At first, he wondered if the snakes might be moving up the baffle the same way utility workers might scale a telephone pole using a belt and pushing off the pole with their feet. But, crucially, snakes do not have feet, so the idea went belly-up. For almost a century, scientists have categorized snake locomotion into just four modes. In rectilinear locomotion, the snake moves in a straight line by stretching its skin and then sliding its skeleton forward. In lateral undulation, all points of the snake’s body bend from side to side. In sidewinding, snakes bend from side to side but also arch their back to lift their body from the ground. In concertina — aptly named after the accordion — the distance between the snake’s head and tail changes as the snake alternates between gripping something static and extending the rest of its body. The brown tree snake’s movements seemed strange, but the time-lapse footage did not make it entirely obvious if the movements marked a new mode of locomotion. So in 2019, Dr. Seibert returned to Guam to replicate the experiment, this time with a 4K-resolution camera and two baffles stacked on top of each other. The new video showed that a brown tree snake could climb the baffle by forming a loop with its body, crossing over itself at least once, and forming small bends in its body to inch its way up. The motion seemed to exhaust the snakes, which paused frequently, breathed heavily and sometimes slipped down the pole. After viewing the video, Dr. Jayne tried and failed to get the brown tree snakes in his lab to climb a pole using lasso locomotion. “Maybe they’ve gotten fat, old and lazy,” he said. Dr. Jayne believes lasso locomotion is an entirely new type of slithering. “Lasso locomotion is in outer space,” he said. “It’s different enough that it doesn’t fit into any of the four categories.” When a snake climbs a tree using concertina, the distance between its head and tail shrinks and swells as it alternates between gripping uphill and gripping downhill on the tree, sometimes at the same time. In contrast, in lasso locomotion, the looping region of the body the snake uses to grip does not change, and the animal moves itself upward with little sideways bends around the circumference of its cylinder. “Given the right circumstances, it’s clear that snakes can find a way, and this new form of locomotion is an example of that,” said Gregory Byrnes, a biologist at Siena College who was not involved with the research. It’s possible that other snakes in the same genus as the brown tree snake are also capable of lasso locomotion, Dr. Jayne said. But one cannot simply walk into the woods and expect to observe a nocturnal snake using an exhausting and specific type of locomotion. “One of the problems of studying snakes is their secretive nature,” he said. “We may not have observed the behavior in the wild because we’re barely observing the animals in the wild.” Although Dr. Savidge and Dr. Seibert were also amazed by lasso locomotion, their awe was tempered with the realization that they would need to take down all the nest boxes they had installed on narrow metal poles. Fruit-eating Micronesian starlings are one of two remaining native forest birds on Guam. “This bird is all there is,” Dr. Savidge said. “There’s nothing else to disperse those native fruits in the forest anymore.” The researchers also tested a new baffle design shaped like an ice cream cone, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom. “Snakes cannot climb that,” Dr. Seibert said, and so far, he’s been right. "
A Colonoscopy Alternative Comes Home | "Most Americans who are due for a colon cancer screening will receive a postcard or a call — or prompting during a doctor’s visit — to remind them that it’s time to schedule a colonoscopy. But at big health care systems like Kaiser Permanente or the federal Veterans Health Administration, the process has changed. Patients who should be screened regularly (age 50 to 75) and who are of average risk, get a letter telling them about a home test kit arriving by mail. It’s a FIT, which stands for fecal immunochemical test. The small cardboard mailer contains equipment and instructions for taking a stool sample and returning the test to a lab, to detect microscopic amounts of blood. A week or so later, the results show up on an online patient portal. Five to 6 percent of patients will have a positive test and need to schedule a follow-up colonoscopy. But the great majority are finished with colon cancer screening for the year — no uncomfortable prep, no need to skip work or find someone to drive them home after anesthesia, no colonoscopy. Last spring, when the coronavirus pandemic closed many medical facilities and postponed nonemergency procedures, this approach suddenly looked even more desirable. “We know that from March to May, colon cancer screenings fell by about 90 percent,” said Dr. Rachel Issaka, a gastroenterologist at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Although testing has resumed, she said, “we’re still not back to where we were.” Yet colon cancer represents the third-highest cause of cancer deaths, after lung cancer and, tied for second place, breast and prostate cancer. Unlike those, colon cancer can be prevented with early detection. With many older adults trying to avoid hospitals and surgical centers, even as their risk of colon cancer rises with age, an at-home test provides an alternative to colonoscopy — one that is both safer, with a lower risk of complications and Covid-19 exposure, and does as good a job. “If your doctor tells you a colonoscopy is better, that’s not accurate,” said Dr. Alex Krist, chairman of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent expert panel that reviews evidence and issues recommendations. “The data show the tests are equally effective at saving lives.” The Task Force is updating its guidelines for colon cancer screening and this year will likely recommend lowering the age at which it should begin, to 45. But the recommendations on the upper end will remain unchanged: Based on strong evidence, adults up to age 75 should be screened regularly. Beyond that age, the disadvantages begin to mount. The Task Force says the benefit of screening 76- to 85-year-olds is small, and that the decision should be an individual one, reached in consultation with a doctor. Colon cancer develops slowly, explained Dr. James Goodwin, a geriatrician and researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Patients at older ages, who typically contend with several other diseases, may not live long enough to benefit. “You cause more harm than good,” Dr. Goodwin said. The advice to stop screening isn’t always popular with patients. “People don’t like to hear about not living very long,” he said. But with colonoscopy, he noted, “you go through an unpleasant experience — or an unpleasant experience followed by an unpleasant diagnosis and unpleasant treatment — for something that, if you’d never known about it, wouldn’t cause you harm.” Even if a test eventually finds colon cancer, surgery plus chemotherapy, the standard treatment, could itself endanger a frail older person. “I would be heavily biased against anyone getting a screening, of any sort, over age 80,” Dr. Goodwin said. Although Americans still rely mostly on colonoscopy, his research has shown that for many older people, that test is overused, either because of the patients’ ages or because they are tested too frequently. Yet screening is simultaneously underused. In 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 70 percent of adults were up-to-date on colorectal cancer testing. About one-fifth of those 65 to 75 had not been screened as recommended. Among those 50 to 65, where lack of Medicare or other insurance probably contributed, only about 63 percent were appropriately screened. The Task Force has found several kinds of screening tests effective, but the ones used most for people at average risk are colonoscopy, at a recommended 10-year interval, or FIT annually. A newer entry, an at-home test sold under the brand name Cologuard that detects blood and cancer biomarkers in stool, may be used every three years, but a study found it to be less effective than most other methods and far more expensive than FIT. When screening is recommended, how does FIT stack up against colonoscopy? Higher-risk patients — including those who have had colon cancer or parents or siblings with colon cancer, those with inflammatory bowel disorders like Crohn’s disease, and those who have had abnormal previous tests, including multiple or large polyps — should seek out a colonoscopy, often on an accelerated schedule. The procedure involves inserting a viewing instrument through the anus to directly visualize an anesthetized patient’s colon. A colonoscopy offers one distinct advantage: if the gastroenterologist spots polyps, growths that over time could become cancerous (although most don’t), these can be removed immediately. “You’re preventing cancer, snipping out the things that could lead to cancer,” Dr. Goodwin said. After a negative colonoscopy, patients don’t need another for a decade. But the procedure’s complications increase with age, although they remain low; the most serious, a perforated colon, requires hospitalization. Cleaning out the bowel on the day before the procedure, in preparation, is disruptive and disagreeable, and Dr. Goodwin notes that older patients sometimes experience cycles of diarrhea and constipation for weeks afterward. Rural residents may find traveling to a facility difficult. The use of anesthesia means that every patient needs someone to drive or escort them home afterward. The prospect of spending two to four hours in a facility, even one using rigorous safety measures, will cause some older adults to postpone testing because of Covid-19 fears. The FIT, which is far more widely used in other countries, avoids many of those difficulties. A marked improvement over earlier at-home stool tests, it requires a sample from one day instead of samples from three, and imposes no food or drug restrictions. A positive result still calls for a colonoscopy, but the great majority of patients avoid that outcome. Why do so many Americans still undergo colonoscopies, then? “There’s a large financial incentive for people who do colonoscopies to do colonoscopies,” Dr. Goodwin said, so patients may not hear much about the alternatives. “Many of my own patients are surprised to learn that there’s another way,” said Dr. Krist, also a family physician at Virginia Commonwealth University. “As they age, they want less invasive methods” and may be happy to switch. Wider adoption of FIT could also save patients and insurers, notably Medicare, a boatload. The home test, which is available through several manufacturers, generally costs less than $20; a colonoscopy can easily exceed $1,000. Moreover, with personalized messages to patients and follow-up reminders to return the kit, FIT use can result in more people being screened. That could prove important when the Preventive Services Task Force lowers the recommended age to 45, which would add 22 million Americans to the list of people advised to undergo colon cancer screening. Their needs, plus a backlog of patients who postponed tests during the pandemic, could swamp gastroenterology practices. “If a provider doesn’t bring up” the possibility of an at-home test, Dr. Issaka said, “patients should feel empowered to ask about it.” Colon cancer screenings, of any type, “are considered non-urgent,” she said. “But they’re not optional.” "
This Spicy White Bean Soup Is a Poem in a Pot | "When there’s ground meat in the fridge and beans in the pantry, dinner almost cooks itself into a big pot of chili, the ingredients simmering together as if they had wills of their own. I make chili so often that not making it when everything is on hand feels like a betrayal of the muscle memory I’ve built up over many tomato-splattered years. But as much as I adore a spicy bowl of chili, there are nights when I’d rather have soup. Especially when I’ve got a bright, vegetable-focused soup on my mind, one that’s filled with white beans and winter greens, spiked with ginger and red-pepper flakes, and rounded out with only a little ground turkey. A soup like this is sharp and lemony where chili is deep and fiery; it’s brothy and pale instead of ruddy and thick. But it’s piquant, cozy and hearty in exactly the same satisfying way. And, because it doesn’t need to simmer for very long to meld the flavors, it’s a lot quicker, too. Like chili, this soup is supremely adaptable. You can use whatever ground meat, beans and greens you have. You can even mix and match, adding a can of white beans and a can of chickpeas if that’s what’s on the shelf. You can use ground chicken, pork, beef or vegan meat instead of turkey. And any greens, from tender spinach to sturdy collards, will find a happy place in the pot. Your choice of greens may require some simple, intuitive finessing. Thicker, more leathery greens (collards, kale, cabbage) need longer to cook than delicate spinach, baby mustard and tatsoi. If the broth condenses too much while the greens simmer, you can add a little water to thin it out. Or then again, maybe a thicker broth is what you’re craving. Aid your cause by smashing up some of the beans so they release their starch as they simmer. This makes the broth silky and rich. Whether thick or thin, make sure to finish the soup with loads of fresh lemon juice. Add it to taste, and stop only when the broth has a lively zing that cuts through the plushiness of the beans. For chili fans, lemon does the same job as a dollop of tangy sour cream. But the citrus is fresher, and more in keeping with the lighter vibe of this still delightfully warming winter soup.

Who Are the 5 People Who Died in the Capitol Riot? | "One had dreamed of becoming a police officer and was injured in a clash with rioters. One was an Air Force veteran and a fervent supporter of President Trump who was shot by the police. Three others were Trump loyalists — including one who sold kangaroos dressed like the president — who suffered what the authorities called “medical emergencies.” These five people from disparate backgrounds and different corners of the country now share one fate: Their lives all ended last week as a mob incited by Mr. Trump stormed the Capitol. Federal prosecutors have opened investigations into the deaths of two — the officer beaten by pro-Trump rioters, and the California woman shot inside the Capitol. But the authorities have released limited information about the deaths of the others, while families and friends have been grappling with scattered accounts of their final actions that day. Here is what we know about each of them and how they died. After serving in the Air National Guard and dreaming of becoming a police officer, Brian D. Sicknick joined the Capitol Police force in 2008. He died the day after he was overpowered and beaten by rioters from the mob at the Capitol. Law enforcement officials said he had been “physically engaging with protesters” and was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher. “He returned to his division office and collapsed,” the Capitol Police said in a statement. “He was taken to a local hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.” In a statement on Monday, his family described Officer Sicknick, 42, as “truly a lovely, humble soul” with a diligent work ethic, and said he was devoted to his job at the Capitol. His family said he also loved and spoiled his dachshunds. Officer Sicknick was hailed as a hero by politicians across the political spectrum. The United States Attorney’s office in Washington opened a federal homicide investigation into his killing, though no one has been charged so far. Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran from Southern California, was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer as she clambered through a broken window leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol. Her last moments, captured from multiple angles on video, show Ms. Babbitt, a Trump flag knotted around her neck, being hoisted to the window as others in the mob shout. Moments later, a shot rings out and Ms. Babbitt falls back, blood pouring from her mouth. The U.S. attorney in Washington also announced it was conducting an excessive-force investigation following her death, which officials called a “routine, standard procedure whenever an officer deploys lethal force.” In her social-media feeds, Ms. Babbitt had celebrated Mr. Trump and QAnon conspiracy theories, and her shooting instantly made her a martyr for far-right activists and Trump loyalists. Kevin D. Greeson, 55, of Athens, Ala., was standing in a throng of fellow Trump loyalists on the west side of the Capitol when he suffered a heart attack and fell to the sidewalk. He was talking on the phone with his wife at the time. Kristi Greeson, his wife, said in an interview that Mr. Greeson had high blood pressure and she had not wanted him to travel to Washington. But she said Mr. Greeson believed the election had been stolen and saw the Jan. 6 rally as “a monumental event.” In a statement to a local news channel, his family remembered Mr. Greeson as a good father and motorcycle enthusiast and said he “was not there to participate in violence or rioting, nor did he condone such actions.” But NBC News reported that Mr. Greeson appeared to have made several combative posts on Parler, a social-media haven for Trump supporters. An account featuring his name and picture urged the violent, far-right Proud Boys group to give “hell” to antifa, a loose confederation of far-left activists. A post in December urged direct action, NBC reported: “Load your guns and take to the streets!” Rosanne Boyland, 34, of Kennesaw, Ga., posted fervently in support of President Trump on social media, followed the baseless conspiracy theories of QAnon and latched onto Mr. Trump’s false claims that he had won the election, family members told The Associated Press. How she died remained unclear on Monday. Family members and friends said they had heard from a friend who was with her that Ms. Boyland had been trampled inside the Capitol during clashes between rioters and the police. But a sister told the A.P. that she had been told by a police detective that Ms. Boyland had collapsed while standing in the Capitol Rotunda. Her family said Ms. Boyland was in recovery from drug addiction and wanted to become a substance-abuse counselor, but had also gone down a dark tunnel of online conspiracies. Some family members said they vehemently disagreed with Ms. Boyland’s decision to travel to Washington and urged her not to go. Justin Cave, her brother-in-law, told Fox 5 Atlanta that Mr. Trump bore some responsibility for her death, saying that the president’s rhetoric incited a riot “that killed four of his biggest fans.” Benjamin Philips, 50, the founder of a pro-Trump website called Trumparoo, was chipper as he drove a van of fellow Trump supporters from their home state of Pennsylvania to Washington. He told The Philadelphia Inquirer that it felt like “the first day of the rest of our lives.” Mr. Philips died of a stroke in Washington, those who accompanied him to the Capitol told the newspaper. The exact circumstances of his death were still unclear, and his family could not be reached for comment. A friend of Mr. Philips told the news channel WNEP that Mr. Philips had sold stuffed kangaroos dressed like Mr. Trump at the president’s rallies. His website — now down — billed itself as a “social network where American Patriots can mobilize against the corrupt communist marxist scummy democrats.” Kitty Bennett contributed research. "
Flags, signs and other items left behind in Capitol riot to be preserved as historical artifacts | Flags, signs and other items left throughout the Capitol by rioters who stormed the building Wednesday will be preserved as historical artifacts in the House and Senate collections and shared with national museums. According to The Washington Post, a spokesperson for the House Administration Committee, which oversees the House curator and Architect of the Capitol, artifacts, including pro-insurrection stickers and flags as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) damaged nameplate, are being collected for preservation as part of an archive on Wednesday’s events. The spokesperson told the Post that seven pieces of historically significant art, including a marble statue of Thomas Jefferson and portraits of James Madison and John Quincy Adams, were covered in “corrosive gas agent residue” and were being sent to the Smithsonian for assessment and restoration.  “On the West Front, the teams identified graffiti on the building near the Inaugural Stands and two broken Olmsted light fixtures,” said a spokeswoman for the Architect of the Capitol in an email. “Statues, murals, historic benches and original shutters all suffered varying degrees of damage – primarily from pepper spray accretions and residue from tear gas and fire extinguishers – that will require cleaning and conservation.” Frank Blazich, a curator from the National Museum of American History, also collected signs and other items left at the scene of the chaos, including a sign that read, “Off with their heads: Stop the steal.” The Hill has reached out to the Architect of the Capitol for comment. Jane Campbell, president of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, a nonprofit chartered by Congress to inspire “informed patriotism,” told the Post that while she was angered by Wednesday’s events, she hopes the preservation of items from the day will force people to remember what took place.“As a historian I want everything preserved,” Campbell said. “I think the people who did the attack on the Capitol are insurrectionist, immoral and bad news all the way around ... but if they left stuff behind, it should be preserved and studied later. We have to look at, ‘What did we learn?’ ”The events Wednesday saw a group of pro-Trump rioters storm through the halls of the Capitol, breaking through windows and doors and ransacking offices throughout the historic building. In addition to the items left and the artifacts damaged, laptops were reported missing from the offices of Pelosi, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and others. A Florida man photographed carrying the Speaker’s lectern was also arrested this week. Five people died amid Wednesday’s chaos, including a woman who was shot by a Capitol Police officer and an officer who died after suffering injuries while responding to the riot. Both fatalities are under investigation.
'Casual Adolf Hitler' hoodie removed from marketplace following complaints | The online marketplace VOVA recently removed its stock for a product labeled “Casual Adolf Hitler Funny Graphic Hoodies New Fashion for Men.” The Simon Wiesenthal Center for International Relations recently penned a complaint to the VOVA headquarters in London, its offices in Hong Kong and its press office in Paris, to remove the antisemitic materials from its website. The hoodie depicts a graphic of Nazi-party leader Adolf Hitler donning his infamous beige military attire. When the wearer places their hands into the pockets of the sweatshirt, it formulates the full picture. "VOVA prides itself that it is ‘on mission to provide high quality products from the most trusted companies worldwide,’” said Wiesenthal Center director for international relations Dr. Shimon Samuels in a statement. "VOVA has betrayed that mission on both levels as describing ‘Adolf Hitler’ as ‘casual’ or ‘funny’ and fails in receiving it from a ‘most trusted company.’ "The banalization of this archetype of hate and discrimination is scathing!,” he concluded. "Destroy all supplies of the Hitler hoodie, investigate and cut all contacts with the delinquent company. "An apology is due to the Jewish community, lest the 'Hitler hoodie' becomes a symbol for neo-Nazi and white supremacist hate."
White House communications director: 'Biden is not going to be breaking news at 1am on Twitter'|  White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield emphasized that President Biden will not seek to “out-do” former President Trump in either the tone or the frequency of his social media use. “I think it's safe to say that you can expect that President Biden is not going to be breaking news at 1 a.m. on Twitter,” Bedingfield said in an interview with 19th News published Thursday. “Trump gathered so many followers and generated so many clicks by putting forth this really divisive, often hate-filled shock content. So, we were never going to try to out-do him in that, that's not true to who President Biden is.” However, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki emphasized to the publication that Biden’s team seldom discusses his predecessor internally. “The truth is, we just don't spend a lot of time talking about Donald Trump or thinking about him internally,” she said. “[M]ost internal calls we have, we don't talk about Trump at all. The majority of them ... I think we spend far less time thinking about Donald Trump than I think the media or some in the public may think we do." .@emarvelous asks: How much will the new administration engage with news about the former president?@jrpsaki says they don't spend a lot of time talking about Donald Trump. There is so much else on their plates right now. pic.twitter.com/8ga24FOGOK — 19thnews (@19thnews) January 21, 2021 Psaki also said that despite the historic nature of the Biden White House’s all-female communications shop, they had secured their positions by being the “best in the businesses.” “'Women first,' sure, but we're the best in the businesses, and this is the group of women who are the best in the business. And that is why we have these jobs,” she added. “Not because we're women ... we should celebrate that we're all women, but it is more that is a group of the best and that's why we're here.” .@emarvelous asks: How do we normalize women’s leadership and how does that impact people’s political imaginations?@jrpsaki says: “This is the group of women who are the best in the business, and that is why we have these jobs.” pic.twitter.com/S86l1SFDUc  — 19thnews (@19thnews) January 21, 2021 Psaki held the Biden White House’s first press briefing Wednesday, hours after Biden was sworn in, and pledged to return to daily briefings under the Biden administration.
Man In Capitol Mob Fired After Wearing His Company ID Badge To Riot | A Maryland printing company has fired one of its employees and contacted the FBI after learning he was a member of the mob that broke into the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, a fairly easy discovery since the man wore his work ID badge during the well-photographed attempt to derail Congress’ certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. US-POLITICS-ELECTION-TRUMP Supporters of US President Donald Trump, including Jake Angeli (C), a QAnon supporter known for his ... [+] AFP via Getty Images Key Facts After the mob forced its way into the Capitol, photographers captured a striking image of several people standing defiantly in a hallway, including so-called “Q Shaman” Jake Angeli, a Trump protest regular whose Viking horns and face paint have turned him into a minor celebrity among believers of the QAnon conspiracy theory. A man carrying a Trump campaign flag stood next to Angeli, and some Twitter users quickly realized he was also wearing what appeared to be an ID badge from the Maryland-based direct mail printing company Navistar Direct Marketing. Navistar Direct Marketing confirmed Thursday one of its employees was spotted at the Capitol, writing in a Facebook post that the man (whom the company did not identify) was fired for cause. Navistar Direct Marketing has reached out to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the man, a company spokesperson told Forbes (D.C. police identified him Thursday morning as a person of interest for unlawful entry into the Capitol). Crucial Quote “[Any] employee demonstrating dangerous conduct that endangers the health and safety of others will no longer have an employment opportunity,” Navistar Direct Marketing wrote on Facebook. Key Background Local and federal authorities are working to identify the Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol building and forced members of Congress to take shelter. The mob was heavily photographed by both journalists and participants, flooding social media with images the Federal Bureau of Investigation and D.C. police are now trying to use to track down suspects, though U.S. Capitol Police arrested just 14 people on Wednesday.
Is Madison Cawthorn the future of Trumpism? | “Cry more, lib.” The three-word tweet from a conservative politician hit social media like a poke in the chest. It was a taunt in the style of Donald Trump Jr., or perhaps former President Donald Trump himself – direct, demeaning, with a gleam of glee. But it wasn’t from a Trump family member. It came instead from Madison Cawthorn, a college dropout and former Chick-fil-A employee, after it became clear on Nov. 3 that he had rolled over Democrats and establishment-endorsed Republicans alike to become the next congressman to represent North Carolina’s 11th district, a seat held until recently by Mr. Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows.  Is Congressman Cawthorn – only 25, with a compelling story of adversity overcome – the future of Trumpism? Born and raised in Carolina mountain country, he’s already a hit with right-leaning media figures who helped power Mr. Trump’s political rise. The day before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, he went door-to-door in the Senate, lobbying GOP senators to vote against confirming President Joe Biden’s Electoral College win.  In some ways he’s a less abrasive figure than the former president. Asked about his touchdown-dance “cry more” tweet, he’s contrite, saying it was a heat-of-the-moment action he now regrets, the result of growing up in a competitive household. He even says he deleted the Twitter app off his phone to prevent a similar mistake. But Mr. Cawthorn’s mix of chutzpah and ambition seems, if not Trumpian, at least Trump-adjacent. When I introduce myself at a meeting in his office he remarks on the irony that my name is Story and I write stories for a living. I tell him I’m an “aptronym,” a word that describes people whose name fits their occupation. He repeats “aptronym” enthusiastically. “Really? Wow,” he says, and then without skipping a beat: “I’m going to rename myself ‘Speaker.’ “Lightly threaten” Representative Cawthorn calls Donald Trump “the best president in my lifetime” and seems tickled by the idea that some observers think he resembles the former U.S. chief executive in aspects of biography and style. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cawthorn has a compelling personal history. He’s not a businessman/reality TV star/former commander-in-chief, but a baby-faced political newcomer paralyzed in a car accident seven years ago. In 2020 he surprised pundits by beating a jostling primary field of Republicans and then cruising to victory in a conservative-leaning district, only two months after reaching the Constitution-set minimum age of 25 for House members. (On Mr. Meadows’ advice, Mr. Trump actually backed another Republican in the primary.) Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cawthorn evokes strong reactions from both supporters and opponents. The former see him as an appealing conservative fresh face. An older woman in a Hendersonville Walmart talks about her new “handsome, young, well-spoken” representative, despite not being able to recall his first name. The latter sometimes express visceral dislike – a Latina waitress downtown resorts to expletives when talking about the rookie congressman. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cawthorn has quickly become a dominant presence on the conservative media circuit. Mere days after his primary win, the young North Carolinian was profiled as a “star on the rise” on Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show. He’s appeared on Sean Hannity’s eponymous Fox show as well. And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cawthorn has been accused of helping incite the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. He was an opening speaker onstage at the Trump rally that day, supporting the false accusation that the election was stolen. Among other things, he commended the crowd for having “some fight” in it. Two weeks prior, at a conference held by the conservative group Turning Point USA, he told attendees they could “lightly threaten” their members of Congress by telling the lawmakers that if they didn’t support “election integrity” then “everybody’s coming after you.” On Jan. 4, he tweeted that the future of the republic now depended on “the actions of a solitary few.” “It’s time to fight,” he wrote. Two days later, when the mob broke into the Capitol and started pounding on doors leading to the House chamber, the congressman, who uses a wheelchair, was uniquely vulnerable. Fellow North Carolina lawmakers were instrumental in helping him around obstacles and down staircases. When the House reconvened hours after the violence, Mr. Cawthorn voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania’s Electoral College votes. In brief remarks to lawmakers, he called for “a new generation of Americans to be radicals.” “If I had a Magic 8-Ball” But Madison Cawthorn is not a clone of Donald Trump. Unlike the former president, he seems willing to change course in the face of opposition. That’s been the case in response to the blowback from his incendiary words prior to the attack on the Capitol. In the aftermath of the mob attack, North Carolina Democrats called for Mr. Cawthorn’s expulsion from office for his “violent language.” A petition on Change.org calling for his resignation became the site’s fastest growing petition the weekend following the riot. Some Republicans were upset as well. Former Henderson County Sheriff George Erwin, who was previously going to be Mr. Cawthorn’s district director in North Carolina, said he was “wrong” to support the congressman. Local conservative voters posted on Facebook about their disappointment with Mr. Cawthorn, one writing that he “deceived a lot of us.” In response the freshman lawmaker backtracked. Pressed on CNN about why, exactly, he had objected to Pennsylvania’s Electoral College votes, Mr. Cawthorn said that “the election was not fraudulent” and that President Joe Biden “is our president.” Asked in an interview about his statements before Jan. 6, he said he had meant that he would be fighting for the rally-goers in his capacity as a lawmaker. “Obviously if I had a Magic 8-Ball and knew what was going to happen that day, I would have added some words, but I wouldn’t have changed anything that I did say,” says Mr. Cawthorn. “I was telling these people that I was going down to the Capitol to fight on their behalf, so they had a representative inside the halls of Congress.” While he says he wants to continue former President Trump’s “America first” agenda, Mr. Cawthorn adds that he prays for President Biden’s and Vice President Kamala Harris’ success. Hours before Mr. Biden took the oath of office last Wednesday, 17 freshman Republican members of Congress signed a letter congratulating the new president and expressing their hope that they may begin to work together for the American people. One of the first signatures, in schoolboy cursive, was “Madison Cawthorn. Vision board for the future Mr. Cawthorn was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and raised a few miles south of that city in Hendersonville. Homeschooled as a youth, his initial ambition was to attend the Naval Academy. He applied in 2014 with a nomination from his then-local congressman, Rep. Mark Meadows, but was denied. Later that year he was returning home from a spring break trip in Florida when his friend who was driving fell asleep at the wheel and crashed the car into a concrete barrier. Mr. Cawthorn spent months in the hospital, and he says doctors gave him a 1% chance of surviving. Today, Mr. Cawthorn is partially paralyzed. The accident was an experience, he says, which has put the rigors of politics in perspective and made him wiser than his years. “I used to be very unempathetic to where I didn’t care about anyone else’s beliefs or what their previous life experiences were. I was just like ‘Okay, well you should get over it and let’s move on,’” says Mr. Cawthorn. “But now, going through my accident... It gives me more empathy to think about people’s past before I make conclusions about them.” But even before the crash Mr. Cawthorn had a knack for leading other people, says Joel Benson, Mr. Cawthorn’s manager at Chick-fil-A. He remembers one night when five buses pulled up unexpectedly, and Mr. Cawthorn, who was then a “team leader,” pumped up the rest of the employees with high-fives and cheers of “We got this!” Mr. Benson suggested Mr. Cawthorn make a “vision board” for his future, with cut-out pictures to represent long-term goals. The final product, says Mr. Benson, included a large photograph of the U.S. Capitol building. True to his vision board, Mr. Cawthorn launched his congressional campaign in December 2019, one day after Mr. Meadows announced his resignation. And when asked at what point in his campaign he knew he would win, he quickly responds: “The day I signed up.” In fact, Mr. Cawthorn’s victory was far from foreordained. There was some bad press: In August a now-deleted Instagram post from 2017 of a smiling Mr. Cawthorn visiting Adolf Hitler’s vacation home “Eagle’s Nest” went viral. In the post he referred to Hitler as “the Führer” and said the visit “has been on my bucket list for awhile, it did not disappoint.” In October, a group of former students from Patrick Henry College, which Mr. Cawthorn attended for one semester in 2016, penned a letter about why they felt Mr. Cawthorn was unqualified for office, citing sexual assault allegations, lies, and theft, from his time on campus. During the campaign, he was criticized for making it seem as if the accident upended his plans to attend the Naval Academy, whereas he was denied before the accident.  But in the end Mr. Cawthorn squeaked past a crowded field of Republicans in a primary run-off. Voters were skeptical of real estate agent Lynda Bennett, who Mr. Meadows endorsed as his replacement. Mr. Cawthorn was a telegenic fresh face. Mr. Meadows and President Trump got behind Mr. Cawthorn for the general election. Donald Trump Jr. came down to campaign. Mr. Cawthorn was a good story, and got lots of free media coverage – as did candidate Trump in 2016. He beat Democrat Moe Davis, an Air Force veteran, by 13 points. “You can’t calculate the value of the publicity he got,” says Mr. Davis. Lunch with Pelosi? Age is an issue that haunts both parties. Despite being the largest share of the U.S. population, millennials, people between the ages of 24 and 39 in 2020, are vastly underrepresented in politics. The top three Democratic leaders in the House are all in their early 80s, while the top three Republicans are all in their mid-50s. In the new 117th Congress, the average age for House members is 58, Senate members average 64, and last Wednesday, President Joe Biden became the oldest president in America history at 78. In contrast, Mr. Cawthorn is the youngest current House member. Indeed, he is the youngest U.S. Representative since the mid-1960s. “If you don’t think young people can change the world, then you just don’t know American history,” said Mr. Cawthorn during his speech at the National Republican Convention in August. “George Washington was 21 when he received his first military commission. Abe Lincoln, 22 when he first ran for office. And my personal favorite: James Madison was just 25 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence.” (James Madison did not sign the Declaration of Independence. He signed the Constitution.) The youngest Congressman also has one of the youngest teams. Mr. Cawthorn brought on his friend from Patrick Henry, Blake Harp, who also dropped out after his freshman year, first as his campaign manager and now his chief of staff. Another college buddy, Micah Bock, came on board as their communications director after graduating earlier this year. Mr. Bock recalls a conversation he had the other day with another congressman’s communications director who bragged about being the youngest person in this position at the age of 26. Mr. Bock says he had to “steal his thunder” and tell the colleague that he is 23. “There’s definitely a learning curve to how things work in Congress,” says Mr. Bock from the team’s new office in the Cannon Building, where the couch throw pillows still have their tags on them. “But so far I think we’ve been doing well. We’ve had a lot of press.... Madison is definitely someone that makes gathering media attention not too difficult.” For all his Trumpian aspects, Mr. Cawthorn may more closely resemble another famous current politician: Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The North Carolinian hopes to become “the AOC of the right” – a young and attractive leader able to influence his party with celebrity and social media might. With 373,000 followers on Instagram, Mr. Cawthorn has more than three top congressional Republicans – House Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Sen. Chuck Grassley – combined. (But it’s still only a fraction of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s follower count.) He posts to his Instagram story and Twitter account daily, reminding followers to catch his appearances on Fox, OANN, or Newsmax. Unlike Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Cawthorn isn’t quite sure what legislative ends he wants to achieve with these means. At least, not in an overarching, ideological sense. But he does have policy priorities. When asked which other member of Congress he’d like to have lunch with, Mr. Cawthorn, without hesitation, says “Nancy Pelosi.” Mr. Cawthorn says his big to-do item is rural broadband, something that is incredibly lacking in his home district (to which this reporter can attest). He hopes that over a meal, perhaps he and the octogenarian House Speaker might be able to hash out a deal.
Telescope sales and stargazers are both looking up these days | Marianne Denton was looking forward to seeing the rock band Tool in concert this summer with her husband and adult son. But then the pandemic hit, and the show was canceled.  So Ms. Denton turned her attention to a different stage: the night sky. With the concert tickets refund, Ms. Denton bought her first telescope so that she could explore the cosmos from her backyard in Reno, Nevada.  “It gives me a chance to explore when I can’t go anywhere,” Ms. Denton says. Ms. Denton isn’t alone. Telescope retailers typically see an uptick during celestial events like eclipses or comets. Indeed, a rare event next week, when Jupiter and Saturn align in what some are calling a “Christmas star” because of the timing, is generating stargazing excitement. It is predicted to appear in the sky on Monday evening, which happens to be the same day as the winter solstice. But this year, sales have gone through the roof, no cosmic alignment needed. “There’s no single day event that’s going to lift the entire industry as much as something like what we’re experiencing now where people have the time, they have the reason,” says Dustin Gibson, CEO of Oceanside Photo & Telescope in Carlsbad, California. In the company’s 74 years, he says, this is the largest influx of amateur astronomy customers ever. Many more people have been gazing at the night sky during the pandemic, often seeking to fill voids left in their lives. With travel restrictions, theaters closed, parties banned, and concerts canceled, amateur astronomy offers a tantalizing replacement.  “If I hadn’t gotten that ticket refund,” Ms. Denton says, “I would’ve gone to that concert and I wouldn’t have purchased a telescope. Finding connection from afar The pandemic makes astronomy a fitting hobby, says Mr. Gibson. People can do it alone in their backyard. But it also offers ways to connect with others virtually, as people post their astrophotography on social media and share celestial experiences at a time when they can’t be physically together. Furthermore, the night sky itself can be a unifying view, says Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.  “Right now, we’re all separated. We don’t get to see our families right now. We don’t get to see our friends. We don’t get to see other people. But all over the world, everyone sees the same stars,” she says. “And so we have that shared experience by going outside to look up … and that is something that can connect us.” Some amateur astronomers, like Mike Kieran in Palo Alto, California, have also found ways to share stargazing with a few friends in a socially distanced manner, setting up telescopes six or more feet apart under the same sky. “It rekindles one’s sense of wonderment,” Mr. Kieran says. “When you look at the night sky, you appreciate the depth and the distances and the scale and the unbelievable beauty.” A cosmic boom  The pandemic has been almost too good for telescope makers.  “We’ve been sold out of telescopes really since the middle of summer,” says Michael Bieler, president of Astronomics in Norman, Oklahoma. Since his father founded the company in 1979, Mr. Bieler says this is the biggest boom they’ve seen – and the industry wasn’t prepared. “It caught every manufacturer flat footed because they don’t have inventory,” he says. And as a result, some orders placed over the summer are just now being filled. While many telescope orders this year have come from people exploring the hobby for the first time, Mr. Bieler says some of the boom has also come from what he calls “zombie astronomers.”  These are people who bought or were gifted telescopes long ago but haven’t used them in perhaps decades. During the pandemic, they’ve sought to resurrect the hobby. Mr. Bieler estimates about 10% of phone calls this year have come from such customers looking for replacement parts or user manuals. Tom Frazier in Vienna, Virginia, is one of those amateur astronomers who dusted off his old telescope.  “I figured, well, if I can’t go anywhere, I’ll just go visit the planets,” he says. Mr. Frazier had purchased the telescope 15 years ago to peer at Mars in a year when it was particularly prominent. But since then, the telescope and tripod had been collecting dust in his garage. “It was like a reeducation. What I had managed to learn, I had forgotten,” he says. “There was a long time when I wasn’t using the telescope, but I’m still glad I bought it.” Retailers aren’t the only ones who’ve noted a rise in amateur astronomy during the pandemic. The Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University puts out a sky calendar for stargazers to know what to look for each month. Not only has there been a notable uptick in subscribers, says planetarium director Dr. Schmoll, but many people who let their subscription lapse a decade or two ago have also renewed it this year. “We can’t do a lot right now,” Dr. Schmoll says. “But people, I think, are also getting tired of screens and looking for a screen-free way of engaging. No telescope needed The cosmos is accessible to anyone – you don’t need a telescope, says Dr. Schmoll. “You can just go outside and look up.” With the naked eye, she says, you can watch the moon change phases. You can see planets. You can see meteor showers. “You can go outside and see this surprise comet that we had this summer,” she says, referring to the comet NEOWISE. “That was fantastic. That was a really nice bright point this year, pun intended.” Another unique opportunity for stargazing comes this weekend into next week. Jupiter and Saturn currently appear in our night sky at the same time. And, in the twilight on Monday night, they will be passing so close to each other’s path that they might appear as one object, which is being called a “Christmas star.” Although the two planets’ paths converge every 20 years in our sky, they rarely pass so closely to each other and typically aren’t visible from Earth when they do. Saturn and Jupiter haven’t appeared this close together and visible from Earth in centuries.  This celestial event is also particularly compelling for Earthlings, says Dr. Schmoll, because, as long as there are no clouds, you can see it from anywhere in the world – including in some places where light pollution blots out the stars.  “We can all go outside and see Jupiter and Saturn converging, all over the world,” Dr. Schmoll says.
