Man Shouts ‘Allahu Akbar!’ Before Photobomb | Amsterdam, Netherlands – According to Dutch police, a crazed man detonated a devastating photobomb on an unsuspecting newlywed couple visiting Amsterdam on their honeymoon. The couple, John and Maggie Hillard from Manistique, Michigan, was taking a tour of the city Tuesday afternoon and taking pictures when a man suddenly appeared out of nowhere and shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before photobombing what would have been a very nice picture of the beautiful Amstel River. Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was on holiday in the south of France but returned immediately for an emergency meeting with the country’s National Security Council. “I condemn any and all photobombing,” the prime minister said. “Thoughts are with the victims of this heinous attack. We have the suspect in custody and are monitoring the situation closely.” “Initial indications very clearly point towards terrorism,” he told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. While Mr. Hillard escaped unharmed, his wife Maggie was treated and released for minor emotional distress. It is currently unknown if the couple plan to pursue charges. The suspect, Amir Fahdi, 39, told investigators that he too was visiting Amsterdam as a tourist and was just asking the newlyweds for directions. “We’re looking into his claims,” said lead investigator, Martyn Verhoeven. Records show Mr. Fahdi was recently questioned by FBI officials in the U.S. after he allegedly launched a cyber attack that left an acquaintance’s inbox destroyed.
Area Mall Offering 10% Discount to Non-Active Shooters | Appleton, WI – The Fox Valley Mall has come under fire (pun intended) for an ad placed in Sunday’s Press Gazette newspaper offering a mall-wide 10% discount to all “non-active shooters” during the month of October. This comes amid a spate of mall attacks throughout the U.S., leaving many area shoppers and victim advocacy groups wondering how such a tasteless joke could ever make its way into print. A spokesperson for the Fox Valley Mall told local reporters they had no knowledge of the ad and said an investigation is underway to determine where it may have originated from. However, the mall will still honor the 10% discount as advertised. “Oh that’s a load of horsesh*t,” said a Fox Valley Mall employee who asked to remain anonymous. “There’s no way that ad just magically appeared in the Sunday paper,” he said, “this is the new age of viral marketing. Better get used to it.” The employee said the sleazy ad fits the mall owners M.O. perfectly. “They knew it would create a stir and get people talking, and that is exactly what’s happened.” Roger Holloway, founder of the victim’s rights advocacy group Triggerz, agrees. “It’s that mentality that says anything is fair game in the name of profits. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past some of these shop owners to stage some sort of false flag attack to get the registers ringing again.” Mr. Holloway says big chain stores like Starbucks are banking on the annual ‘War on Christmas’ hysteria to widen their year end profit margins. “They know that holiday cup and all the make-believe controversy that comes along with it is the key to their quarter’s earnings,” he said, “thank God for idiots who get offended year after year after year over a coffee cup eh?” All calls to the investment group that owns the Fox Valley Mall have not been returned as of press time.
Millions Mourn As Rocker/Activist Ted Nugent, Age 71, Found Alive | Millions of Americans are in mourning after news broke this afternoon that rocker/activist Ted Nugent was still alive. Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 71, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement: "Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold." PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences. Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts. President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival. Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived. Ted Nugent, 1948 –
Woman Comes Forward With Shocking Allegation: “I Was Not Raped By Bill Cosby” | <National Report>In a shocking turn of events, area woman Joyce Taylor has broken her silence and proclaimed, “I was not raped by Bill Cosby.”  This news came on the day that two more defendants joined in the growing defamation case against the once beloved entertainer. According to Ms. Taylor, she once met with Mr. Cosby decades ago at a Hollywood night club at the age of 17.  As the night progressed, she became increasingly intoxicated before her boyfriend, 18 year-old Danny Stevens, helped her home where she awoke the next morning alone, with full memory of what had not transpired the night before.  In a sworn statement given to officials earlier today, Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not raped by Mr. Cosby?  Was I not pretty enough?  Did I do something wrong?  I mean I may have been a bit overweight, but I was still rapeable (sic).  These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night in 1974.” Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be raped, but in a way, I think we have all been raped by Mr. Cosby.” Since November, at least 15 women have come forward claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby.  Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show” from 1984 to 1992, has not been formally charged in connection with any of the allegations and has denied his involvement. Cosby’s career has unraveled since the allegations began and he has hired an extensive team of Public Relations experts in attempt to save what is left of his reputation going so far as to blame the victims themselves. In the years since the non-incident took place, Joyce Taylor has sought counseling and has been treated for depression. “The last forty years, my weight’s gone up and down like a yo-yo.”  When “The Cosby Show” went off the air in ’92 I got things under control, but when he came back with another show four years later, I blew up like a damn balloon.  Now he’s in the news again and I’m fighting the urge to ‘make the plate my mate.’  It’s a struggle,” admitted Taylor, “but I’m not going to turn not being raped by Bill Cosby into a negative.” It is presumed there are many more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being raped by Cosby, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional victims.  This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been raped by Mr. Cosby. Cosby’s publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say | <National Report>This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming. Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.” “Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday.  “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water.  But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner.  Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.” WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however.  “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun.  But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time.  If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.” The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally.  Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years.  But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market. “Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning.  “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less.  Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station.  What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?”
Alex Jones Suggests Flying False Flag at Half-Staff for Shooting Victims | <Austin, TX>Renowned radio show host and fake news creator Alex Jones has reportedly asked his audience to fly the false flag at half-staff in honor of today’s shooting victims.  While details of the shooter have not been released, Alex is likely spinning up all kinds of untruths in order to satisfy his legion of brain-dead followers. “Was the shooter a Muslim? A Mexican?  Antifa?  BLM?  A disgruntled employee? Was he radicalized by the gay agenda?  Why did he hate Christians?  Did anyone actually die?  Are these the same crisis actors used during the Vegas shooting?  Did you see that Craigslist ad recently seeking extras for a mass casualty exercise?  How was Hillary involved?  Could Obama have done more to prevent this attack?  Did some crazed liberal shoot up this those folks to blame Trump and take away our guns?  If this story is even true why did none of the victims shoot back?,” Alex likely opined during this afternoons editorial meeting. This is a developing story.  Please check back for additional information.
Man Shouts ‘Allahu Akbar’ Before Blowing Up Friend’s Inbox | De Pere, WI – A Wisconsin man is resting comfortably after an explosion rocked his inbox late Saturday afternoon. The blast occurred at approximately 4:45 pm leaving the victim, Anthony Stewart, 41, physically fine but emotionally drained. “The toll is a heavy one,” said a chaplain visiting the home. A spokesperson for the Brown County Sheriff’s Department told the Green Bay Gazette that Amir Fahdi, 39, was questioned and released after multiple witnesses said he shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before launching the cyber attack outside a De Pere thrift shop. Anthony said the onslaught began with a barrage of Facebook comments and soon erupted into a full-on mind fuck of emails, text messages, and gaming requests. “I barley know the guy,” said a shaken Stewart. “I updated my Facebook status with a Nirvana video and he became unhinged.” “The motivation behind the assault has not yet been determined,” said Chad Manning, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “We are exploring all possibilities of a potential motive,” he said. Amir blew up Anthony’s Facebook page with practically a novella’s worth of comments about seeing Nirvana play live in the early nineties and even claimed to have hung out with the band in Madison, WI, while they recorded demo tracks for their mega-smash Nevermind album. “You could tell he was full of shit, but instead of calling him out I just typed ‘wow’ and ‘awesome’ hoping he’d get the hint and leave me alone,” Stewart said, “big mistake on my part.” News of the explosion was reported by media organizations such as Breitbart, Infowars, and Fox News. A tweet Sunday morning from Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said: “I am deeply troubled by the bombing in De Pere. These stories cannot be swept under the rug #WIBombing.” After several failed attempts to dodge Fahdi, a desperate Stewart told Amir he had to go care for his two-year-old son who may be coming down with a cold. “He wanted to come to my fucking house and treat him with homemade cold remedies. I was flabbergasted.” It was then that Anthony checked his email account and discovered over 30 “ultra-rare” Nirvana MP3s had flooded his inbox. “This guy has serious issues,” said Stewart, “he may be radicalized.” Brown County Deputy Daniel Benning said the public is not in danger and suggests that if anyone has any problems with Mr. Fahdi to simply ‘unfriend’ him and move on.
Trojan Name New Ultra-Thin Skin Condom after Donald Trump | Trojan, the world leader in modern condom technology, announced today the company has developed the world’s thinnest-skin condom to date, and will market the new condom after the thinnest-skinned man to ever run for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will be available for a limited time and sold exclusively to novelty shops and truck stops nationwide. The Scum Bag© will come in two different shades of orange, regular & extra-dark, and be marketed towards “the small hands kinda guy.” Trojan President Hugh Jardon said his company does not normally mix business with politics, but sees an opportunity to cash in on America’s fascination with all things Trump, especially after the real estate mogul himself brought his penis to the foreskin of American politics. Jardon says Trump was a “no-brainer” when his marketing team asked if he had anyone in mind for the new ultra-thin skin dunce cap. “The Donald has the thinnest skin in the world, so from a marketing standpoint it just made perfect sense.” Asked if he was worried about a possible lawsuit from Trump, Jardon is confident Trojan’s legal department “took every precaution” to avoid any legal trouble. “Unlike Mr. Trump, I don’t have the skin of a bat wing. I can handle someone who challenges me or questions my decision making.” The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will compete against other similar Trump novelty condoms currently flooding the marketplace, while offering consumers a higher standard of protection. Smaller men will now have a quality product to help them “overcomb their fear of pregnancy and STD’s” while still delivering “the highest sensitivity” the condom market has ever seen.
5 Great Ways To Entertain Guests During Your Thanksgiving Celebration | For those of you who are actively avoiding the Black Friday Shopping frenzy, and actually looking forward to spending meaningful time with your family and friends, National Report has lovingly put together a list of new and unique ways to create memorable experiences during this year’s Thanksgiving celebration. Surprise Thanksgiving Roasts One great way to involve folks in holiday oriented entertainment is to make the tried-and-true Thanksgiving meal into an unwitting scavenger hunt! Similar to the traditional Mardi Gras King’s cake, in which a small coin or figure of baby Jesus is hidden inside, we recommend you hide something small or unexpected inside of at least one of the main dishes or desserts. Staff picks include a set of false teeth submerged in Great Aunt Muriel’s homemade cherry cheesecake, or a modest bag of mixed prescription medication concealed in the mashed potatoes. Once these unanticipated objects have been discovered, announce the finder as the subject of a brutal holiday roast! This game is a hilarious idea for all-inclusive entertainment, as everyone can criticize and berate the winner under the pretense of light-hearted ribbing, providing hours of amusement, and an acceptable excuse to dish out both emotional abuse, while creating fond memories for years to come. Truth Or Dare Do you suspect your family and/or friends are holding out on some dark secrets or privy to juicy need-to-know gossip? Well, there’s no better way to really know your loved ones more intimately than to play an alcohol-fueled variant of truth or dare, also known as Spin the Bottle! If alcohol may not be effective for the family that already regularly drinks together, just use the CIA’s favorite truth serum, Scopolamine, and spike their drinks. Of course, children must be excluded from this game due to its adult themes, so I suggested you shut them away in a distant room as to prevent any trauma due to all the familial skeletons figuratively pouring out of the closet. Who knew that Aunt Terri actually DID get rid of Uncle Berry for his $100,000 life insurance policy, and that he wasn’t simply a victim of an unfortunate, and unsolved hit-and-run accident? You never know what you might learn about your family’s history! Outdoor Scavenger Hunt Like most Thanksgiving celebrations, it is likely your guests have had at least two other meals under their belt before the main event. Consequently, in order to work up a genuine appetite for your Thanksgiving spread, have them embark on a harrowing scavenger hunt through a rented corn maze! (The bigger, the better.) Not only will it make them feel genuinely thankful for all the work you’ve done to host this holiday event but also provide you with enough time to actually finish the cooking! Provide your party with a flare gun and a small flashlight in case they get lost in the maze, or are unable to understand the clues you’ve dispersed randomly around the cornfield. That way they can find each other, and hopefully signal for help as darkness falls. The first ones out of the maze get to have the initial choice of their favorite foods, while the last to finish have to wash all the dishes, providing them with plenty of incentive to participate! Cosplay Our next suggestion is to recreate an authentic Thanksgiving holiday by cosplaying as your favorite pilgrims from the Mayflower, complete with costumes and a vastly limited spread of food reminiscent of a meager Paleolithic diet. Hire real Native Americans to sit alongside your family and eat with you, just as they had with the pilgrims! Keep it traditional by trading them in dried corn, glass beads, and firewater for their service, and insist that they too attend the meal in historically accurate attire, such as leather loincloths, feathered headbands and a necklace of real human scalps. Invite The Homeless Turn your house into a surprise soup kitchen for the disenfranchised and unfortunate without informing your guests before they arrive! Before turning your homestead into an impromptu food trough for the poor and downtrodden, it is highly recommended that you put up chicken wire to prevent them from getting into undesirable areas, such as your organic tomato garden, underwear drawer or medicine cabinet. Thanksgiving is full of human-interest pieces and Facebook images about selfless individuals providing hot meals to the needy on a day known for generosity and goodwill. Bring this instant karmic good luck to you and all your loved ones by getting them unknowingly involved with your philanthropic endeavors. Put them on the spot as they are surrounded by shambling drug addicts and the streams of urine left in their wake. They will not be able to refuse an opportunity to brag about their charitable and selfless holiday on the nearest social media platform, especially before starting their Black Friday binge shopping!
Emmy Awards Announce Addition of “Best Crisis Actor” Category | Crisis actors have been fighting for over a decade to get a category for their work added to The Oscars, but it was the Television Academy this week that showed its branch is more open minded when it comes to updating its awards ceremony to reflect the current landscape of entertainment. The Television Academy announced Friday that the Emmys are expanding to include a “Best Crisis Actor” category. TV Academy chairman and CEO Bruce Rosenbloom tells National Report, “It’s time to acknowledge the incredible work crisis actors are doing. They bring some of the most heart-stopping performances to the screen, sometimes while events are still playing out on live television. It’s time they are recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the industry.” Crisis actors are professional actors used by government agencies and/or the mainstream media to deceive the public with portrayals of trauma and human suffering. Specifically, they act as victims or witnesses in staged mass shootings or hoax terrorist attacks (i.e. ‘False Flags’). While many in the industry still believe crisis actors are one dimensional and undeserving of their own award, many are just now starting to appreciate the challenges they face on set. How can the crisis actor take action in the imagined world that will move the storyline in an unforeseen direction? How can he or she make critical decisions that explore different options without giving up the narrative that is necessary to deliver a compelling experience? Those questions and more will ultimately decide who is nominated for this year’s prestigious new award. Veteran crisis actor, Xavier Daniels, says while it would be an honor to win the first ever Best Crisis Actor Award, it’s not what motivates him. “I want the people hiring me for a gig, be it the government or just some local gun shop looking to boost sales, to know I won’t let them down. I will never break character like some of these hacks, and they can feel safe knowing I’m in the role.” Makayla Williams, a newbie to the scene, says most crisis actors never make it past the audition phase. “You have to really dedicate yourself for this kind of performance art,” said Williams. “Sometimes to get into character I will have my boyfriend beat the hell out of me, so when I go live on TV my adrenaline is still pumping. Hopefully it helps give the viewers at home a real sense of authenticity.” Jimmy Kimmel returns to host the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards airing live on Sunday, September 18th on ABC.
New Navy Football uniforms honor tradition of ignoring Marine Corp | ANNAPOLIS, Md. — The U.S. Naval Academy debuted custom uniforms last week in preparation for the upcoming Army-Navy football game which honors the naval tradition of ignoring the Marine Corps, sources confirmed today. “This year's Army-Navy uniform pays tribute to the Naval Academy with numerous special features as seen on the Yard with the first being the blue and white marble pattern of the helmet and shoulders,” said Academy Superintendent Vice Adm. Sean Buck. “Some people are claiming that because the design incorporates marble, which is a rock, that we’re indirectly alluding to the Marine Corps. But marble is a fancy rock, much too fancy for those crayon eaters.” Officials said the academy was honoring a long-established practice of ignoring that the Marine Corps exists, which happens most often during defense budget season. And official Navy policy calls for “dicking [the Marine Corps] over” whenever possible, as set out in a naval administrative message released in 1923. For that reason, the only direct callout on the uniform comes in the form of a Marine eagle, globe, and anchor placed as close to the uniform’s crotch as allowed by the NCAA. In recent years, West Point has joined Annapolis in releasing custom uniforms ahead of the annual football game. But while Army has leaned on honoring specific combat units and battles they participated in, the Navy’s inspiration has included their mascot, football team, water, and now, stone buildings. “We had Blue Angel uniforms that one time which is a combat adjacent unit,” said Ed Zeigler, a spokesman for Naval District Washington. “We also thought about doing Navy SEAL uniforms but decided looking like a Sopranos bathroom would be classier.” “Next year, it could be a ship’s bilge,” he added. “Bilges are very important parts of the ship.” Despite their lack of recognition on this year’s uniform, Marines make up approximately 20 percent of Naval Academy graduates, officials noted of a deeply embarrassing fact to Academy staff and personnel. And though swag related to the new uniform will not be available on Marine Crops bases due to “budget cuts,” according to Zeigler, “the Navy has offered up older, outdated, torn up uniforms they can buy.” The Marine Corps could not be reached for comment in the barracks and calls to a local strip club went unanswered.
Trump adds prominent barracks lawyer to 'legal dream team' | WASHINGTON — Prominent barracks lawyer Pfc. Ruben Hernandez is advising President Trump to issue himself a pardon for inciting a deadly riot inside the nation’s Capitol this week that should also shield him from criticism for an inevitable retweet in support of “QAnon shaman,” sources confirmed today. Hernandez, an Army infantryman stationed at Fort McNair and frequent legal advisor to the president and anyone standing within 10 feet of him, told reporters his client was in good spirits and believes he will be totally and completely exonerated, especially if he pardons himself. “A pardon is basically, like, it’s not guilty, you know what I mean bro? I mean Mr. President,” Hernandez told Trump during a 74-minute tweet exchange, during the height of the melee on Capitol, in which hundreds of Trump supporters took over the Senate and House floor. “U sure?” Trump tweeted back. “Mos Def Mr. P,” replied Hernandez, “I KNOW how this wurks,” he wrote, adding a winking emoji and praying hands. Hernandez, who prides himself on a long list of barracks acquittals, along with “like, only a few” dishonorable discharges, takes the role of gratis legal advisor to the commander in chief seriously. “I spent, like, $49.99 on the Rudy Giuliani weekend guide to the practice of law, you know? There was at least an hour on presidential self pardons in the section on defending war criminals and defense against the dark arts,” said Hernandez. “Not to mention the free, $99-value bonus pamphlet on beating drug tests,” he added. “Hashtag worth it. ”The private rounds out what Trump has called a “legal dream team” that includes Lin Wood and Kim Kardashian, though the president hopes to add Jackie Chile and Saul Goodman. Hernandez, who in the past has offered his legal services to Eddie Gallagher, Michael Flynn, and that guy in Room 224 whatever his name is, feels confident in the success of his game plan. “If it doesn’t fit you must acquit, miright?! That for sho has to cover charges of sedition. Worst case scenario you have to wait until the next guy pardons you for inciting a coup.” At press time, Trump was strongly and greatly considering taking Hernandez’s legal nuggets of wisdom and issuing himself a pardon. “Frankly it sounds more legit than anything Sidney Powell has offered so far,” the President mused aloud.
Troops deployed to US southern border wondering if they can go home now | EL PASO, Texas — Soldiers currently deployed to the U.S. southern border have begun asking their congressional representatives if they’re allowed to redeploy home yet following a Pentagon announcement of troop reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan, sources confirmed today. “We’ve been here waiting on that migrant caravan since the congressional election in 2018,” said Capt. Pat Thompson, a company commander. “I feel like if they were going to show up, they would’ve done it by now.” “Do you see any caravan?” he asked, gesturing at the empty desert. Skeptics have long believed the initial deployment of troops to the southern border was a political maneuver by President Donald Trump to drum up national security concerns ahead of a midterm election. But as years have passed, White House officials insist that the refusal to withdraw troops is evidence that wasting soldiers’ time and keeping them away from their families is a normal function of government no matter who is sitting in the Oval Office. “You can’t claim this was done as political theater if everyone forgets they’re there,” said acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. “These men and women are heroes and saying we’re wasting their time denigrates their service.” “Especially since they don’t really have a reason to be there,” he added. Despite the absence of a teeming horde of anchor-baby-wanting, communism-imposing, government-teat-sucking migrants, the soldiers currently deployed along the Mexican border have achieved significant success, at least as measured by Hesco barriers constructed and piss bottles filled. And several units deployed to the badlands of Arizona, inspired by the Nazca lines in Peru, combined forces to build a concertina wire design in the shape of a penis that is visible from space. “The space dong was an important step to securing the area and keeping morale up,” said Thompson. “If that caravan does show up, the terrain will funnel them from the ball sack to the tip and allow Border Patrol to pick them up pretty easily.” Congress has offered strong support for the troops as guardians of the nation’s freedom but has done essentially nothing to directly address sending them home. Analysts say this is likely because Congress is currently adjourned and won’t be working again until 2021, if ever. Several soldiers tweeted directly at President Trump hoping for a response, but the president blocked them after learning the soldiers had voted by mail-in ballot. Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden said that after his inauguration he would return troops to their home stations so they can gear up for deployment to a Middle Eastern country to be named later.
Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper refuses to leave Pentagon until he can figure out USAJOBS site | WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Mark Esper has told his staff he won’t leave the Pentagon until he figures out the USAJOBS website, sources confirmed today. “It keeps saying I’ve got the wrong password,” Esper said of the federal government's primary hiring portal. “I pushed backspace more than anybody today.” President Donald Trump fired Esper on Monday, months after their relationship soured amid differences over the use of active-duty troops in American cities and whether McDonald’s was better than Burger King. Trump immediately named counterterrorism czar Chris Miller to the Pentagon's top job, giving the former Green Beret a notable 72-day-long bullet point to add to his resume after he gets fired on Jan. 20. But Esper is pushing back on the rushed timeline, citing delays in reactivating his USAJOBS account, updating his resume, deciphering overly complicated announcements, and determining which positions he is qualified for. “Trump has his timeline. I have mine,” said a frustrated Esper while trying to understand the need for two-step verification when applying for federal jobs. “I can’t even have my cellphone in here.” Aides to Esper said he had spent the morning yelling at his computer and slamming his mouse on his desk out of frustration with the USAJOBS password recovery process. “Secretary Esper is quickly learning that the stress of being in charge of the world’s most powerful military is nothing compared to overcoming the challenge, confusion, and headaches involved with navigating USAJOBS,” said Sally Anderson, an Esper aide. “I mean, does anyone really know the purpose of an occupational questionnaire? Like, what does ‘VEOA’ mean, anyway?” USAJOBS, a famously antiquated and archaic website that no one besides IBM’s Deep Blue can navigate, is a well-known barrier to applying for federal jobs for most people who are not currently federal employees. Still, many federal employees find the website frustrating and claim the website itself is often responsible for triggering dark thoughts and feelings of potentially hurting others by doing work. The Office of Personnel Management, which administers USAJOBS, continues to develop new strategies to simplify the federal job application process, which was developed in the 1970s. This month, OPM plans to add the national suicide hotline telephone number to the homepage of USAJOBS, which they intend to cite as their signature 2020 achievement, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. OPM efforts are unlikely to be immediately useful to Esper, according to officials, who said he continued showing frustration with the process as two Pentagon police officers carrying empty boxes were seen walking into his office. “The Secretary of Defense announcement still shows my application status as ‘Pending.’ What does that even mean? I’ve been in the job since July 23, 2019. That’s insane,” Esper yelled. “Will everyone just calm down? We will get through this together,” Esper said to his staff members, who are all still employed.
Opinion: If you call your spouse Household 6, I get to call your divorce a change of command | Look, I get it. You love the Army and you want to bring everything about it into your daily life. I’ve been there. When I was in high school I got way into "Trainspotting" and started calling my friends “mates.” I was like 14, but whatever, I’m not here to judge. What I’m saying is we all do stupid stuff we aren’t proud of later. So if you want to call your wife Household 6 you go right ahead. If you want to talk about needing to check “the training schedule” when someone asks you what you’re doing this weekend or discuss an “exfil plan” from the bar, that’s your prerogative. I won’t even call you a douchebag for it. At least not loud enough that you can hear me. But you need to know that the use of military lingo doesn’t end when the good times in your marriage do. You need to know that if you call your spouse Household 6, I get to call your divorce a change of command. Not only that, but I am going to ask you questions like whether she’s “already checking out a new unit” or “hopped on some Rear-D while you were deployed” or even if I can get a video of her doing some “partner assisted PT.” It’s only logical for me to deal with your loss by throwing something you did that annoyed me back in your face, and the commander of your household leaving the scene is a perfect opportunity. So I’ll ask you these things and more because the opportunities are pretty much endless no matter the reason you and your significant other elected to cut slingload on holy matrimony. And let’s be honest, the first time I ask you if she used to be a drill sergeant because I hear she’s been smoking privates, you’re going to get mad. That’s natural. But I hope you can appreciate the fact that I put up with you and your slang equivalent of a high and tight by telling me you “take all commands from the tower” when talking about your wife. Also, don’t be surprised if I insist on treating your divorce like an actual change of command ceremony. If I know the time and place you’re getting this done, you had better believe I’ll print out programs, and that I’m going to be there in uniform, with the guidon, 30 minutes early. And you absolutely need to be aware that I’ll be expecting to hear a speech, eat some Costco sheet cake, and get released for the rest of the day. I’m not trying to be unreasonable. I won’t insist we sing the "Army Song" together to close out the ceremony. I just want to make sure we understand each other before you come at me all angry because I’m asking who your little fire team of kids is going to live with now.
Raytheon wins contract to send six guys to stare at shit | WASHINGTON — Raytheon won an exclusive contract to send six retired guys out to stare at shit, sources report. The six guys will come out next week and will wander around for a month. For a few hours a day they will stand in front of a computer stack and stare at it with their arms crossed. Afterward, they will grab hold of a supervisor at a wildly inappropriate time. “We're here for the reboot, so you need to take the system down,” they'll say, referring to a system that has been working without an issue for years. One will pull out a laptop and announce the instructions on how to restart a computer. Nobody is allowed to ask if this multimillion dollar contract could be completed by giving an E-4 the laptop. While the reboot is going on, the contractors will start talking amongst themselves. “They hired us for our experience, but when I was in we didn't even have this,” one of them will say. “This all went to shit because of Hillary Clinton.” “Looks good,” one will say when the computer comes back online. All six guys will then spend an hour telling everyone how to maximize their disability rating. At press time, Raytheon was finalizing the clause allowing their contractors to go to the front of the chow line every meal.
Guam finally capsizes | THE PACIFIC OCEAN—After years of warnings from Congress, the island of Guam has finally capsized, according to several Department of Defense officials familiar with the matter. Satellite imagery confirmed that the island disappeared into the Pacific Ocean early Thursday morning. There were no survivors. Senior defense officials say the island's inversion was the result of poor management by the Navy and Air Force. “What happened this week was that the Air Force aircraft that are usually on the north side of the island were away on a training mission,” said a senior Navy civilian, speaking on condition of anonymity because he still didn't believe this had actually happened. “At the same time, a destroyer squadron docked at the naval based on the south side of the island.” “That unbalanced the whole thing, and it just sort of tipped over and sank.” The armed forces typically carefully manage the balance of Pacific islands in order to prevent them from capsizing. In 1943, Tarawa nearly inverted during a furious battle between U.S. and Japanese soldiers there, after the Japanese retreated too quickly to one shore. The two sides negotiated a brief truce and agreed to stack all the coconuts they could find on a beach opposite the last-ditch Japanese positions in order to make the atoll more stable. Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), who has long expressed concerns that DoD activity on Guam could put the geological stability of the island at risk, told reporters he was furious no one had paid attention to his warnings. “Our hearts go out to the Guamese—Guamians? Guamoans? Whatever. The Guamericans and the military personnel now lost,” he said. “But make no mistake: The Department of Defense's reckless mismanagement of the island's weight and balance caused this tragic disaster.” U.S. competitors have taken note of the tragic event, as well. In an editorial in the Chinese Global Times, People’s Liberation Army Colonel Wang Xiangsui stated that China's artificial islands in the South China Sea must be careful to avoid the fate of Guam. “Whatever the Americans claim happened, all we know for certain is that they have demonstrated the capacity to use balance warfare to upend an entire island,” he wrote. “This capability will likely be used in the future against Chinese island territories. We must not allow anyone to overturn our sovereignty.”
Army stunned to learn Fort Hood had commander | FORT HOOD, Texas — Following the announcement that the U.S. Army had removed Maj. Gen. Scott Efflandt from command of Fort Hood, sources report that leading up to this action senior Army leaders had been shocked to learn that there was a commander there in the first place. From a prostitution ring, to missing soldiers, to financial fraud, Fort Hood and the surrounding vicinity have been a hotbed of recent criminal activity and alleged leadership negligence. It reached the point that senior Pentagon commanders had assumed that most senior leaders at Fort Hood must have been among the numerous soldiers to have gone missing. Maj. Bob Davis, who assisted a Pentagon Advance Team sent to the post to establish a command presence, described the operation that revealed Fort Hood’s leadership was still present on the post. “Based on everything that had occurred at Hood over the past year or so, we didn’t take any chances,” he said. “We sent in a company to secure the headquarters building, as we assumed it had been abandoned or possibly occupied by hostile forces. It was quiet, except for a few tumbleweeds drifting down the street and some wild dogs. The soldiers secured each room, but we were surprised when we found the commander’s office occupied by Maj. Gen. Efflandt.” Not only was the commander present, but the surrounding offices had evidence that an entire leadership staff was active. “This kind of blew our minds,” admitted Davis. “I mean, Fort Hood is a huge installation, right? Big posts like this come with big problems, but damn. You can understand our confusion rolling in and finding out that someone was in charge and still things are as jacked-up as they are.” “It was awkward,” said newly appointed commander Maj. Gen. John Richardson IV. “I burst in there behind the advance team and there was Efflandt on the phone. At first I was like ‘Who the hell are you?’” “When he said that he was the commander, I thought ‘no way.’” “I mean, come on,” said Richardson, gesturing out the window at the post. With Richardson now in command of Fort Hood, Efflandt will assist until investigators determine whether Efflandt’s leadership warrants punitive action, such as promotion to the rank of lieutenant general and/or retirement with full benefits and a lifetime pension.
Lifeless corpse almost buried with military honors—then they realized it was a living GS-15 | ARLINGTON, Va. — Whoa. We knew the military made mistakes from time to time, but we never thought it could gaff up quite like this. When coworkers found this lifeless corpse apparently dead at its desk in the Pentagon, their first thought was that it must have been a soldier who was courageously killed in the line of duty while preparing a PowerPoint slide on readiness. Sure, it looked a little old and decrepit, but who knows how long it had been rotting there in the bowels of the puzzle palace? Mourning this brave service-member's fate, they went through the whole process of planning for a military burial, with an honor guard detail and everything. They even ordered it a new dress uniform and were about to lay it down in a flag-draped casket when it suddenly sprang to life and said it had to leave because Friday was its flex day. Turns out this wasn't a dead soldier at all, but a living GS-15. Who would have thought! "Even though it's alive, I'm still kind of worried about the GS-15," said Master Sgt. Patrick Hughes, one of the soldiers who found it. "It hasn't replied to emails or answered its phone in months. "Although it does occasionally 'reply all' to all-hands emails with a vague and incomprehensible one-line message, so I'm convinced it's alive." These soldiers certainly learned their lesson, but if you come across a lifeless corpse in your office will you be able to tell if it's a dead body or a living GS-15? "There's really no sure way to tell," said coroner Melvin Burke. "The best you can do is assign it some work and see if it magically disappears. If that's the case, you have a government civilian on your hands."
Marine crayon eating competition goes horribly wrong | CHERRY POINT, N.C. — Catastrophe has consumed Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point after a Marine died of crayon consumption, what sources call "one of the top three worst case scenarios for Marines." Now investigators are trying to determine how this could have happened. An inquiry into the command climate concerning crayon consumption is currently being coordinated by the brass at Camp Lejeune. Of chief concern is whether or not Charlie Company was complying with the crayon consumption code by sticking to the three Cs: color, crunch, and chew. Navy Lt. Doug Forsythe is conducting the JAGMAN investigation, and has focused his efforts on "C3." "Our preliminary interviews have revealed that apparently no one told Pfc. [Mykal] Smith he needed to chew the crayons," Forsythe said. "The Marine Corps has long been known for their ability to shut up and color, and there has never been an instance throughout its beautiful history to declare anything contrary to that fact," Forsythe added as Charlie Company's snipers watched from a hide on a hilltop nearby. Individuals who were present at the crayon eating competition have cited the lack of specific instructions from higher. The three Cs were mentioned, but only the first two were defined, and the third C was considered an implied task. Four Marines in addition to Smith were hospitalized, and one Air Force liaison officer is in critical condition after drinking too much champagne and choking on his caviar.
Real life study: Masked schoolchildren are harmed physically, psychologically, behaviorally and suffer from 24 distinct health issues | (Natural News) A first-of-its-kind study, involving over 25,000 children, reveals that masks are harming schoolchildren in many physical and psychological ways and have a negative effect on their behavior, focus and interest in learning. These negative effects are censored from social media, under-reported by the media, and ignored by government officials. Of the 25,930 children studied, the database includes at least 17,854 health complaints submitted by parents. These health issues and impairments were observed in approximately 68 percent of masked schoolchildren who were forced to wear a face covering for an average of four and a half hours per day. Prolonged, forced, strict mask wearing destroys the health of children. The registry, established on October 20th, 2020, asked 363 doctors to inform parents and teachers that they can report the health impacts they are witnessing from prolonged mask use of children. The health issues were exhaustive and included irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), less happiness (49%), reluctance to go to school/kindergarten (44%), malaise (42%) impaired learning (38%) and drowsiness or fatigue (37%).” Nearly a third of the children sleep worse than normal, and quarter of the children had developed new fears. Hundreds of children were less cheerful, less playful and most were unusually irritable. Even more concerning, (29.7%) had shortness of breath, (26.4%) experienced dizziness, and hundreds of children suffered from feelings of weakness, a feeling of disease, accelerated respiration, tightness in the chest, and short-term impairment of consciousness. Universal mask wearing is destroying the health of children, making their immune system more susceptible to disease. (Related: The CDC is developing a nationwide “medical police state” program to track vaccine compliance; may lead to “medical kidnapping” of children.) Masking of schoolchildren is a medical experiment that should be a parent’s choice and require informed consent. Around the world, fathers and mothers are losing their parental rights as asinine medical interventions are mandated on their children in the school setting. Children are being psychologically raped, as adults force them to believe that their breath is a constant source of disease transmission, that they have a moral duty to ensure that their diseased breath never infects another person. Children are being trained to fear one another, to fear the world around them, and to quiver in obedience to authority and medical fraud. Will these institutions be held liable for the physical, psychological and behavioral harm they continue to impose on children? Teachers and counselors, who are required by law to report child abuse, are now actively participating in the abuse of children and bullying parents to comply. Every day, authorities turn a blind eye to the psychological harm they impose on children with mandatory masking of each child’s mouth and nose. What else can be forced onto children under the guise of keeping everyone “safe?” Masking of schoolchildren is a medical experiment. Mask manufacturers have not conducted independent studies for long term use of their products on adolescents. Therefore, parents are not given informed consent so they can make a choice that is best for their child. In most cases, the schools are dictating what parents must do to their child’s body, setting unlawful precedent that tramples on the medical privacy rights of the family while perpetuating institutional abuse of children that is liability-free. “There are no manufacturer-independent studies on the use of masks for children and adolescents that are certified as medical products for occupational safety in professional applications,” the study authors stated. “In addition, due to the unknown materials used, there are no findings on the potential protective effects or side effects of the often home-made ‘everyday masks’ worn by the majority of children. In view of the ongoing measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular the varying obligations for children and adolescents to wear masks in school over a longer period of time, there is an urgent need for research.” Check out HealthFreedom.news for more on the harms of forcing masks on children.
Same media now vilifying Trump supporters for Capitol incident EXCUSED actual domestic terrorism of left-wing BLM rioters | (Natural News) Those who only listen to what the mainstream media has to say about current events will be left with the false impression that violent, right-wing neo-Nazis stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6 and tore the place to shreds while attacking anyone who crossed their path. In truth, this “mob” was given permission by security to enter before engaging in a peaceful protest of the fraudulent election – even making sure to follow the velvet rope walkways as they “stormed” the facility. You would never know any of this from reading mainstream media headlines, though, which are deliberately falsifying what happened to create maximum outrage among the Trump-hating left – all the while going out of its way to excuse the actually violent “protests” that took place back in the summer in response to the death of George Floyd. Not only is the fake news media lying about what took place, but it is urging outraged readers and viewers to dox the identities of those who were present during the incident so they can be fired from their jobs and persecuted for the rest of their lives. USA Today, for instance, published a series of 29 photos from the Capitol incident, asking its readers to identify who is seen in the photos. The goal is not to harass these individuals, the paper claims, but rather to help the fake news outlet “report this important story.” “Considering the amount of anger that the Capitol invasion provoked, it’s no surprise that USA Today’s call was answered by many people,” RT reports. “Some readily provided names and other details about the rioters, while others pointed to people they suspected of being involved.” Capitol “invasion” is the left’s Reichstag Fire false flag event to complete destruction of the Constitution. It is a practice of fascism that those claiming to be fighting fascism have embraced as the “solution” to President Donald Trump and his pesky supporters, who continue to resist the left-wing agenda of socialism and hate. The good news is that not everyone is on board with trying to destroy the lives of people for mere association with a political party. “Since when do journalists conduct police work?” asked one USA Today commenter. Another noted that the call to ID people in the photos represents the “merger between press and state.” “You are supposed to be reporting on the violence, not investigating the perpetrators!” wrote another. “I’m in favor of prosecuting all who are guilty but let the @fbi and @mpdc do the police work! Info should be sent to them, not Gannett / USATODAY!!” In truth, the entire incident was staged to the point that many are calling it America’s Reichstag Fire. The left is using it as an excuse to try to steamroll what freedoms and liberties remain in our country, despite the continued erosion of our Constitution at the hands of neoconservative war hawks and far-left socialist “progressives.” “In the name of ‘protecting the constitution,’ they are tearing it to pieces. In the name of ‘preventing a coup,’ they are carrying one out in front of our eyes,” writes Kit Knightly for Off Guardian, noting that 1/6/21 is likely to become a shorthanded date like 9/11 and 7/7. “It will become just one more grand sweeping illusion upon which the teetering structures of U.S. Imperial power are built,” he adds, further explaining that the official narrative of the Capitol “invasion” is a farce based on lies and misinformation. What we are now witnessing is the manifestation of the famous quote from Huey Long, which reads: “Sure, we’ll have Fascism in this country and we’ll call it anti-Fascism.” More of the latest news about the fraudulent 2020 election can be found at Trump.news.
CDC study: Severe allergic reactions to coronavirus vaccines happening at a higher rate than flu vaccines | (Natural News) Federal health officials have announced that severe allergic reactions to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are happening at a higher rate than similar reactions to flu vaccines. This announcement was made by health officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who came out with a study, published in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, saying that the allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, are happening at a rate of 11.1 per million doses administered. Seventy-one percent of the reactions are occurring within half an hour of vaccination. On the other hand, flu vaccines are only estimated to cause 1.3 cases per million doses. CDC insists coronavirus vaccines are still safe. Despite the fact that people are multiple times more likely to get an allergic reaction to a coronavirus vaccine than the flu vaccine, CDC officials still want to call the incident very rare. “The anaphylaxis rate for COVID-19 vaccines may seem high compared to flu vaccines, but I want to reassure you, this is still a rare outcome,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier during a call with reporters. Messonnier is the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It’s still a good value proposition,” she added. “Even if the rate is higher than what we see after routine immunizations, anaphylaxis still remains rare.” Despite the reassurance, Messonnier said that the CDC has been constantly updating its recommendations as allergic reactions and other “adverse events” are reported. The CDC has further advised people who experience an allergic reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to not get the second dose. Health workers who administer the vaccines have also been directed to observe anyone with a history of anaphylaxis or a history of allergic reactions to vaccines for at least 30 minutes after they are vaccinated. (Related: UK to deploy “resuscitation facilities” in coronavirus vaccination centers to treat wave of allergic reactions caused by vaccines.) CDC messaging regarding the matter of vaccinations for people with a history of allergic reactions has also been very confusing. While they stress that the benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks, they have warned people with a history of allergic reactions to any of the components in the vaccines to not get them. “Our vaccine safety systems haven’t picked up any worrisome signals,” claims Messonnier. “This means that right now the known and potential benefits of the current COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the known and potential risks of getting the COVID-19.” “That does not mean, however, that we couldn’t see potential serious health events in the future.” The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued emergency-use authorizations for big pharma companies that have developed coronavirus vaccines, like Moderna and Pfizer. They are reviewing the data regarding serious adverse events and are trying to disprove the fact that there is a connection between them and the vaccines. Messonnier herself believes that the reactions could be “coincidental.” Messonnier also briefly addressed reports that many healthcare workers are considering not getting vaccinated, saying that it was definitely concerning. “It makes it exceedingly important that we get the correct information to healthcare workers and we quickly dispense with misinformation. We need them not only to protect themselves, but to educate their patients so everyone understands these vaccines… have a good safety profile, they are working and they … can help us end the pandemic.” Watch this special episode of Brighteon Conversations with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he and cancer researcher, vaccine skeptic and health freedom advocate Ty Bollinger discuss the falsehoods regarding coronavirus vaccines and rip apart the global conspiracy surrounding them. Number of severe allergic reactions to coronavirus vaccine rising rapidly. As of press time, the CDC has reported that there have been at least 21 cases of anaphylaxis from the nearly 2 million people who have received the first shot of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine between mid to late December. “We closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed,” said a Pfizer spokesperson to mainstream news outlet CNBC. Of the 21 cases that the CDC has published, 18 have a documented history of allergies or severe allergic reactions to drugs, medical products, food or insect stings. Seven of these people also have a history of anaphylaxis, including one who had an anaphylactic episode following a rabies vaccine, and another following an influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. Nineteen of the cases were treated with epinephrine, 17 were treated at a hospital’s emergency care department. Worse still, four were hospitalized, including three who were sent to intensive care. The CDC notes that an additional 83 vaccine recipients have experienced allergic reactions that were not considered to be severe. These symptoms include rashes, excessive itching and scratchy and irritated throats. These symptoms occur within half an hour after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. Similar to the patients who experience anaphylaxis, these cases also have a history of allergic reactions. There is no federal database for confirmed severe allergic reactions, and the CDC’s current data is missing reported incidents coming out from Dec. 24 to the present day. As of Wednesday, Jan. 6, nearly 5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been administered. This means that, at a minimum, there have been 55 severe allergic reactions to the vaccines. The CDC also reports that they have received 4,393 reports of side effects or other serious reactions following receiving a shot of the vaccine through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a federal government program for vaccine safety co-managed by the FDA and the CDC. The federal government has ruled out most of these cases, stating that they aren’t serious enough to be considered an allergic reaction or are “unrelated” to the vaccines. As federal and state governments continue to roll out the coronavirus vaccines over the next few months, it is likely that more people are going to report experiencing reactions to the vaccine.

Virus expert claims coronavirus pandemic is “the greatest hoax” ever perpetrated on the world | (Natural News) An expert virologist, pathologist and former chairman of a prominent medical association in Canada told officials in the province of Alberta that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a great hoax. This is why policies and mandates regarding face masks, social distancing and destructive economic lockdowns “should all stop tomorrow.” On Nov. 13, city councilors in Alberta’s provincial capital of Edmonton met to discuss the possibility of extending the city’s mask mandate for public places to the end of the year. Listeners of the meeting were allowed to phone in to discuss their support or opposition to the mandate. One of the people who called in was Dr. Roger Hodkinson. Hodkinson introduced himself as a former chairman of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada’s Examination Committee in Pathology and the CEO of Western Medical Assessments, a biotechnology company that manufactures COVID-19 tests and which has offices in Edmonton and North Carolina. Hodkinson is also a certified general pathologist, a fellow in the College of American Pathologists and is recognized by the Court of Queen’s Bench in Alberta as an expert in pathology. (Related: Canadian Armed Forces launch investigation after soldier calls for public disobedience on coronavirus vaccinations.) “There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians,” said Hodkinson, who made it very clear he was against mask mandates and any attempt to continue or strengthen the lockdowns. Hodkinson continued by calling the coronavirus pandemic “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.” He added that he firmly believes that COVID-19 was “just another bad flu.” “Positive test results do not, underlined in neon, mean a clinical infection,” he added, stating that many people who have COVID-19 but are asymptomatic should stop “driving public hysteria” around the virus because it is leading to more lives being ruined by mask mandates and economic lockdowns. Watch this special Brighteon Conversations episode with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he interviews Dr. Paul Cottrell regarding the lies being propagated regarding the coronavirus vaccines, PCR tests and more. Hodkinson argues against masks and lockdowns. Hodkinson went on to talk about how he believes face masks do not work in the way people think they do, saying that policies that promote or require the use of paper or fabric masks “are simply virtue signaling.” He continued by saying that face masks are “utterly useless,” that “there is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever” and that any attempts to push mask mandates are “utterly ridiculous.” “They’re not even worn effectively most of the time. It’s utterly ridiculous. Seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people – I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense – seeing these people walking around like lemming obeying without any knowledge base to put the mask on their face.” Hodkinson also lambasted social distancing protocols, calling them as useless as face masks because the coronavirus is spread “by aerosols which travel 30 meters or so before landing.” Social distancing rules in Alberta recommend that people stay at least two meters away from each other. There is a lot of evidence to support Hodkinson’s claims against masks and social distancing. A major Danish study has found that face masks do not provide “clear protection” to the wearer from being infected by COVID-19. This study, which involved around 6,000 participants, found that the difference in infection rates between people who wore masks regularly and people who didn’t is “not big enough to conclude with certainty a benefit of using face masks with regard to protecting oneself from infection.” Another study concluded that while so-called “non-pharmaceutical interventions” like social distancing, lockdowns and face masks may help slow down the spread of COVID-19, it will most likely result in a massive surge of flu cases next winter. Hodkinson continued by saying that nothing can really be done to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and that all people can really do is to protect those most vulnerable and most likely to succumb to the disease, such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. The expert virologist noted that only “one in 300,000” under 65 have died from the coronavirus in Alberta. Based on these statistics, it is “outrageous” for Alberta – and the rest of Canada, for that matter – to lock down their entire economies, especially for a disease that he believes is “just another bad flu” for younger demographics. “It’s politics playing medicine, and that’s a very dangerous game,” concludes Hodkinson. “I’m absolutely outraged that this has reached this level. It should all stop tomorrow.” Medical groups in Canada strongly criticize Hodkinson. Other prominent groups and individuals in the medical field have since come out against Hodkinson for his statements. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada claimed that Hodkinson was never a chairman. They did not deny that he has been a certified general pathologist since 1976. Their statement went on to say that they believe COVID-19 is “a serious threat to the health of Canadians,” and that the Royal College supports all health recommendations and orders given to the public by the Public Health Agency of Canada, including mask mandates, social distancing regulations and economically restrictive lockdowns. The Alberta Medical Association also came out against Hodkinson. They released a statement on social media that laboratory physicians in Alberta endorse “the use of masks, hand washing and physical distancing along with all other public health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” The Associated Press has attempted to reach out to Hodkinson but has not received a response.

From EMF damage to carcinogens: 10 Reasons to say no to 5G | (Natural News) What makes 5G so dangerous? It’s difficult to give a simple answer to this question because there are so many ways in which this wireless technology is harmful. Here is a look at 10 reasons why you should say “no” to 5G. 1. It amplifies EMF damage. We already know that electromagnetic fields (EMF) are dangerous, with researchers like wireless radiation expert Dr. Martin Pall demonstrating how they can damage fertility, DNA and the heart and brain. 5G actually amplifies that damage using the body’s voltage-gated calcium channels, with even Dr. Pall himself saying that the “5G rollout is absolutely insane.” 2. It is potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic. The millimeter wave frequencies used by 5G have been shown to cause mitochondrial DNA damage that is passed down through generations, and with this mutagenesis often comes carcinogenesis. Defenders of the technology are quick to point out that there aren’t specific studies showing it causes cancer, but that is only because the technology is too new for long-term studies to have been carried out – and there aren’t any studies showing that it’s safe, either! 3. Exposure limits are outdated The FCC has reaffirmed exposure limits that were established back in the 1990s, well before even 2G existed, much less 5G. These safety standards are incredibly outdated and do not take into account all of the evidence that has emerged in the intervening years on the harms of RFR. 4. It’s killing insects Insects are sensitive to 5G EMF waves, with exposure leading to an increase in body temperature and other problems. Their small body sizes mean they are highly vulnerable, and losing our planet’s insects could spell disaster for mankind. Former UN Staff Editor Claire Edwards said at a Stockholm anti-5G rally: “It’s interesting to note that in the last 20 years, we have lost 80% of our insects. And if we get 5G, we’re going to lose 100% of our insects. When the insects go, we go, too.” 5. Its waves can replicate inside your body Before 5G was approved, RF researcher Arthur Firstenberg published a 5G analysis that explained how its very short EM pulses that are delivered in bursts can replicate within the human body, creating a series of tiny new 5G antennas inside of people. These little antennas then re-radiate the EMF and send it even deeper into the body. 6. It can manipulate your skin The frequencies used and broadcasted by the 5G network impact our sweat ducts, which serve as helical antennas for it. Anything capable of manipulating your body’s biggest organ simply cannot be good for your health. 7. Insurance companies won’t underwrite Big Wireless Major insurance companies like Lloyds of London have outright refused to insure Big Wireless against claims related to 5G. Their report compared these wireless technologies to deadly asbestos in the sense that initial research was “inconclusive” and it became painfully obvious that it caused cancer when it was too late. 8. It’s already causing effects in people From Los Angeles firefighters developing ailments after being too close to 5G towers to hundreds of birds falling down from the sky in a 5G test in the Netherlands, all signs point to an abundance of health problems in many forms of life after 5G exposure. 9. Respected science journals are concerned about it One of America’s most credible and longest-running magazines, Scientific American, has issued a strong warning about 5G dangers, highlighting concerns about both its known and potential risks. 10. 5G cell antennas will be everywhere One of the most disturbing aspects of this technology is the fact that its limited reach means that telecommunication companies will need to place cell antennas roughly every 100 to 200 meters, which means they will be near a significant number of people’s homes, exposing them to dangerous millimeter waves. These ten points are really only a fraction of the problems posed by 5G technology. The truth is that we don’t yet know just how extensive the long-term damage will be, but what we do know about the risks of its predecessors makes it clear that the world is in for a slew of problems when 5G is rolled out everywhere.
Every major Western media outlet has been wined and dined by communist China | (Natural News) Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) filings from the Department of Justice (DoJ) show that nearly every mainstream media outlet in the West has been broadcasting “favoable coverage” of communist China in exchange for “private dinners” and “sponsored trips.” The China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), which is funded by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has maintained a close relationship with media outlets like CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, which continue to “disseminate positive messages” about China in exchange for the gifts they receive from the communist Chinese regime. Other mainstream media outlets on the dole from China include MSNBC, Forbes, the Financial Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, ABC News, the Economist, The Wall Street Journal, TIME magazine, the Los Angeles Times, AFP, The Hill, The Atlantic and BBC. CUSEF also targets American colleges and universities with offers of funding for policy research, high-level dialogues and exchange programs, so long as these institutions do the bidding of China and cast the communist country in a positive light. A report from the United States government explains that the goal of CUSEF and other associated people and groups is “to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party.” “The United Front strategy uses a range of methods to influence overseas Chinese communities, foreign governments, and other actors to take actions or adopt positions supportive of Beijing’s preferred policies,” it further adds. Mainstream media really is a communist Chinese propaganda front After forging an agreement with the American lobbying firm BLJ many moons ago, CUSEF set out to “effectively disseminate positive messages to the media, key influencers and opinion leaders, and the general public” about China and the CCP. With BLJ’s help, CUSEF has been providing journalists and journalism students with “familiarization trips” to China, which involve plenty of wine and dine experiences that propagate the illusion that communist China is a great place to be run by great people. In 2009 alone, CUSEF was able to generate 28 media placements as a result of four journalist visits. BLJ was also able to secure “the publication of 26 opinion articles and quotes within 103 separate articles” on behalf of CUSEF that same year. These op-ed pieces were published by media outlets like Newsweek, The Nation, The Chicago Tribune, the National Journal, Congressional Quarterly, U.S. News & World Report and the Washington Note. On average, BLJ’s efforts “directly contribute to or influence” three articles “per week,” The National Pulse reports. While some institutions of higher learning such as The University of Texas at Austin made the decision to divest from CUSEF due to its CCP ties, the same cannot be said for media outlets like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, both of which continue to participate in “private dinners” at the home of BLJ’s CEO. Other media outlets that, according to a 2012 filing, do the same include Forbes Asia, the Financial Times, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, the Economist, Newsweek, the Nation, ABC News and CNN. NPR (National Public Radio), which is funded with American taxpayer dollars, has likewise sent its journalists to China to meet with CUSEF officials. While UT-Austin may have divested from CUSEF, many other colleges and universities across America have not. In fact, many of them continue to churn out pro-China curriculum and communist influence on impressionable students, much like the mainstream media does to everyone else. According to Foreign Policy magazine, CUSEF is “a registered foreign agent bankrolled by a high-ranking Chinese government official with close ties to a sprawling Chinese Communist Party apparatus that handles influence operations abroad.” For more related news about mainstream media corruption, be sure to check out Pandemic.news.
CNN wants Fox, Newsmax de-platformed for somehow being “complicit” in Capitol false flag incident | (Natural News) The left is now aggressively trying to extinguish all conservative and independent media outlets, along with all “offending” social media platforms and user accounts, by intimidating and threatening the cable companies and other providers that service them. New Jersey state Assemblyman Paul Moriarty, a Democrat, wrote in a text to a Comcast executive that he does not appreciate networks like Newsmax and Fox News still being broadcast on Xfinity following the Capitol false flag attack that occurred on Jan. 6. According to Moriarty, Fox and Newsmax should be removed from all cable providers because they were allegedly complicit in the attack, which resulted in some overturned furniture and strewn trash inside the halls of the Capitol building. An Air Force veteran by the name of Ashli Babbit was also shot to death by law enforcement, despite being unarmed, during the melee. “Fox and Newsmax, both delivered to my home by your company, are complicit,” Moriarty whined to the Comcast executive. “What are you going to do??? You feed this garbage, lies and all.” Xfinity, a product of Comcast, currently broadcasts not only Newsmax and Fox but also One America News (OAN), which Moriarty thinks is likewise responsible for the “domestic terrorism” that occurred when protesters were let inside the Capitol building by law enforcement to take pictures at Nancy Pelosi’s desk, as well as engage in other non-violent stunts. “After Wednesday’s incident of domestic terrorism on Capitol Hill, it is time TV carriers face questions for lending their platforms to dishonest companies that profit off of disinformation and conspiracy theories,” reported KITV, clearly buying into the false flag narrative. “After all, it was the very lies that Fox, Newsmax, and OAN spread that helped prime President Trump’s supporters into not believing the truth: that he lost an honest and fair election.” Will CNN, MSNBC also be held responsible for inciting George Floyd riots? If Fox and Newsmax need to be removed from the cable lineup for supposedly inciting the Capitol “insurrection,” then what is to become of CNN and MSNBC, both of which openly incited riots, looting and destruction following the George Floyd incident? As you will recall, cities all across America were burned to the ground at the hands of Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa domestic terrorists who looted Target stores, set fire to an AutoZone, beat innocent people with bats for being white, blocked traffic and committed many other atrocities in the name of “social justice.” Even our nation’s capital was terrorized by these same far-left groups, and it all hinged upon the left-wing media’s false reporting and stirring the pot about “police injustice.” Does this mean that all participating fake news networks should also be removed from Xfinity? We would say so, which is why we are encouraging all of our readers to contact their cable companies or other subscription services and demand that every left-wing media outlet from CNN to MSNBC be removed from television for encouraging liberals to riot in response to George Floyd. Race-motivated incitements of rioting and violence simply cannot be tolerated, and this is what the establishment media does on a daily basis. In fact, they have been doing it ever since President Donald Trump first decided to run for office, encouraging the public to insurrect against him and every agenda item he tried to accomplish throughout his first four years in office. This makes the mainstream media and its followers domestic terrorists who, based on Moriarty’s line of reasoning, need to be silenced in the interest of maintaining civil society.

Classified UFO info must be disclosed within 6 months according to newly signed bill | (Natural News) Classified information about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) must be made public in the next six months according to the coronavirus stimulus bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last Sunday. The provision is written as a “committee comment” under the annual intelligence authorization act, which is rolled into the $2.3 trillion relief and government funding bill. Drafted by the Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the provision requires the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and other agency heads under the Department of Defense, to “submit a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of the Act to the congressional intelligence and armed services committees on unidentified aerial phenomena.” Though it’s still unclear how much of the classified information will be made public, former intelligence officials welcomed the provision and said that it would help clarify numerous questions the public has in light of last year’s declassification of three Navy videos of UFOs. Bill seeks detailed report on UFOs The omnibus appropriations legislation includes the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (IAA). Introduced in June last year by Rubio, the act allots more resources toward intelligence gathering and analysis to protect American national security. One provision of the act requires the disclosure of what the Pentagon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and their counterparts know about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Any report on the matter should address “observed airborne objects that have not been identified” and include a “detailed analysis of unidentified phenomena data collected by: a) geospatial intelligence; b) signals intelligence; c) human intelligence; and d) measurement and signals intelligence.” The report should also include a detailed analysis of data obtained by the FBI and derived from investigations of intrusions into restricted United States airspace. Also, it should contain an assessment of whether a foreign adversary is responsible for a UAP. (Related: Human-like aliens may have come from another dimension, according to declassified FBI file.) The provision, however, is not included in the actual text of the nearly 6,000-page bill and is instead part of the committee comments at the end of the IAA. All the same, its stipulations have the full force of the law and indeed have already taken effect since the legislation’s enactment. Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough also confirmed that the provision is part of the appropriations bill, noting the department is aware that the Senate Intelligence Committee required the disclosure of UAPs. Transparency advocates welcome UFO provision The provision has been greeted warmly by former intelligence agents who have been pushing for more transparency following the release of three Navy videos of UAPs last year. Nick Pope, a former UFO investigator for the U.K.’s now-defunct Ministry of Defence, said: “I welcome this move, which shows how seriously the phenomenon is being taken in the intelligence community.” But Pope noted that it remains unclear what a UAP report will say and how much can be made public given the highly classified nature of some of the information. Chris Mellon, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for intelligence, said that the provision gives Americans “an objective basis for assessing the validity of [a UAP] and its national security implications.” Mellon hopes that the next administration will execute its oversight prerogatives because the concerns of the public and military personnel have been ignored for too long. In April last year, the Pentagon declassified three Navy videos of UAPs. The department said that the reason for the release was “to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos.” The videos were leaked before they were declassified and triggered numerous speculations regarding their veracity. Several lawmakers called for more transparency after the footage was officially made public. Rubio, for one, emphasized that Americans must be aware of UAPs as these might pose a threat to national security. “We have things flying over our military bases and places where we are conducting military exercises and we don’t know what it is – and it isn’t ours,” said Rubio in July last year.

Spain to maintain a list of people who refuse coronavirus vaccinations | (Natural News) Spain has said it would list down the names of people who refuse to be vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). In a Dec. 28 interview with broadcaster La Sexta, Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa said the list of individuals who refused vaccination would be shared with other “European partners,” but clarified that it would not be made public or shared with employers. “What will be done is a registry … [to] be shared with our European partners … of those people who have been offered [the COVID-19 vaccine] and have simply rejected it,” Illa said. The health minister also noted that the list “is not a document which will be made public” and the data in it will be “treated with the utmost respect for data protection.” Illa mentioned that the list was aimed at ensuring that there were no errors in the system and that any person gets the opportunity to be immunized against COVID-19. “The way to defeat the virus is to vaccinate all of us, or the more the better,” he added. Spanish citizens receive the COVID-19 vaccine on a voluntary basis. Spanish authorities later clarified to Deutsche Presse-Agentur that the register of people who rejected the COVID-19 vaccine was only meant to collect clinical data. Only those who showed up for immunization and then rejected it would be registered in the list, the Spanish authorities added. (Related: Vaccine industry pushing state laws to TRACK your “vaccine status” with pharma surveillance tactics – urgent action needed.) The health minister’s announcement came amid mass COVID-19 vaccinations in the country. Ninety-six-year-old Guadalajara nursing home resident Araceli Hidalgo was the first person in the country to receive the coronavirus jab Dec. 27. A 48-year-old worker at the nursing home where Hidalgo lived was the second person to be inoculated. Up to 20 million Spaniards are expected to receive the coronavirus jabs by June 2021, less than half of the country’s 47 million total population. Other European countries appear to be following Spain’s example According to a poll by the Belgian state-funded Centre for Sociological Research, the number of respondents hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine dropped to 28 percent in December 2020 from 47 percent the previous month. The same poll also found that 40.5 percent of respondents were willing to have the vaccine. Meanwhile, 16.2 percent of respondents would avail of the vaccine if it is shown to be reliable. Spain offers the COVID-19 vaccines for free as of writing, with the Spanish health service contacting those eligible to receive the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency. Spain’s neighbors in the European Union have also put forward similar ideas of tracking their citizens for vaccination. France is seeking to establish a registry of vaccinated citizens, alongside their health conditions. But this campaign is off to a slow start as officials look to build trust in the system. Polls in the country reflect utmost skepticism towards vaccination, with less than half of the French populations intending to get vaccinated. (Related: Americans to be issued vaccination record cards after receiving the coronavirus jab.) On Twitter President Emmanuel Macron stated that vaccination will not be mandatory in France. “I’ve said it before and I’m repeating it: The vaccine won’t be compulsory,” he said. “The cost of the vaccine is completely covered. There are no charges. Let’s be proud of our health system.” Austria will roll out an electronic vaccination certificate where both patients and authorities can store vaccination records in the first quarter of 2021, Health Minister Rudolf Anschober told journalists in the capital Vienna. He added that the country plans to bolster its COVID-19 vaccination efforts with an information campaign. Anschober remarked: “We won’t convince fierce anti-vaxxers, but I do see many who are undecided.” Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, Spain currently has a 1.8 million COVID-19 caseload with 150,376 recoveries and 50,442 deaths. France has 2.6 million COVID-19 cases with 197,726 recoveries and 64,204 deaths. Meanwhile, Austria registered 355,352 COVID-19 cases with 328,974 recoveries and 6,059 deaths.

This is what happens when you defund the police: Shootings in Portland skyrocket by over 116% | (Natural News) Portland has been a hotbed for Antifa and Black Lives Matter-led anti-police riots and demonstrations during the latter half of 2020. This has resulted in a massive spike in shootings, according to reports, which point out that gun violence-related incidents are up by over 116 percent compared to the previous year. According to Portland-based CBS-affiliate KOIN, the city logged nearly 900 shootings in 2020, compared to just 393 shootings in 2019. The city also recorded the highest number of homicides since a wave of gang violence swept through the city nearly 30 years ago. The latest homicide incident occurred on Christmas morning, Dec. 25, when 33-year-old Jaron Weeks became the city’s 53rd shooting fatality of the year. He and a second person were shot outside an apartment building in the Lloyd District of the Northeast Portland neighborhood. The second person was hospitalized and is still recovering. Weeks was identified by the Portland Police Bureau three days after the incident. This was followed by a wave of gun violence on Dec. 26, when multiple people were sent to the hospital after a series of shootings across the city. At around 8:30 p.m. in the Montavilla District in Northeast Portland, the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) received reports of gunshots in the area. A short while later, a 15-year-old girl walked into an area hospital with a gunshot wound that was not considered to be life-threatening. Around 9:45 p.m. in Southeast Portland, officers arrived at the scene of a gun violence incident and found multiple bullet casings, a vehicle that had been shot several times and “significant amounts of blood.” While the PPB investigated the incident, a man walked into a nearby hospital with a serious gunshot wound. The man is expected to survive. Just after 11 p.m. on the same day, PPB officers responded to the third shooting incident of the evening at the Brentwood-Darlington District in Southeast Portland. Several homes were shot at multiple times. While there were people inside the homes at the time of the incident, no injuries were reported. The final incident occurred just moments after the third shooting. A convenience store worker in Northeast Portland reported that several shots were fired into the building he was currently working in following a heated confrontation between himself and three teenage customers. The worker confronted the individuals after he caught them attempting to steal several items. As the group ran out, several shots were fired. Gun violence isn’t the only criminal action rocking the city. There have also been multiple reports of other kinds of violent behavior, such as assault, since the beginning of the period of engineered civil unrest back in late May. PPB officials also believe that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns associated with it have also made the situation much worse. “They know we are busy,” said Derek Carman of the PPB. “So, people are more emboldened to carry firearms and use them against each other and not only one or two shots but multiple. There have been thousands of shots fired in the city this year, and it is unfortunate for the community. Portland police turning to community due to lack of proper options to tackle gun violence Portland police have stated that they want to turn to the community for help in reducing the gun violence plaguing their city. According to one PPB officer, over 220 people have been shot in 2020, many of whom contributed to the record number of homicides. “The number of bullets that must have been flying around our neighbors, city streets, sidewalks – it’s awful,” said PPB Lt. Greg Pashley. PPB officials have traced the rise in gun violence to the sudden move to disband the bureau’s Gun Violence Reduction Team. This move was made over the summer following an intense anti-police campaign by Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists and rioters who argued that the team was disproportionately targeting the city’s people of color. (Related: Violent crime in Portland goes up after city council disbands elite police team.) Since the team’s disbandment, the PPB has not been able to formulate a clear plan to handle the sharp increase in gun violence. This is why they decided to ask the Portland community for help in intervening with people who may be inclined to commit acts of violence. “Social services, government organizations, non-government organizations, church-based organizations – so that people feel as if they have support and options other than to act out violently,” said Pashley. “We’ve come together to mask up, to stay home to keep others safe,” said PPB Chief Chuck Lovell in a televised address pleading for help. “We have come together to do our best to stop the spread of a deadly disease. Violence is also a disease that kills and our community is suffering the consequences.” Learn more about how the defund the police movement has directly led to an increase in violence in cities like Portland by reading the latest articles covering anti-police events at Violence.news.
Facebook Will Delete Any Post In Support Of Kyle Rittenhouse, Declares Him A Mass Murdere | The Kyle Rittenhouse case is indeed a curious and contentious one. The 17-year-old is charged with two counts of homicide after a shooting during riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The first reports focused on the fact that he’d driven up from Illinois and had numerous pro-police and pro-Trump posts on his social media accounts, which seemed to cement in place a narrative about a far-right mass shooter who’d traveled to Kenosha for blood. What came out in the days following the shooting made the narrative a bit more complex. Video compiled by The New York Times’ visual investigations team (WARNING: graphic link) shows Rittenhouse was being chased at the time of the shooting and that a gun was fired into the air from behind him. One individual seems to have lunged at him, prompting him to fire. He tried to flee the scene and allegedly killed another man when he was rushed by multiple individuals; he fell and fired shots, killing the second person. Rittenhouse says he acted in self-defense. While he’s yet to enter a plea, according to The Wall Street Journal, it’s safe to assume he’ll be pleading not guilty — which means we’ll likely be looking at a trial that’ll be a cultural flash-point, no matter how you feel about it. TRENDING: Washington Post Promises Catastrophic Violence if Biden Does Not Win If you support Kyle Rittenhouse, however — or even if you just don’t believe he’s guilty of the charges he faces, no matter what you think of his motives as an individual — you’re probably not going to be able to talk about it on Facebook. That’s because the platform has already decided Rittenhouse’s actions constituted “mass murder” and will take down messages of support for the accused. The social media giant confirmed its position to Breitbart News after conservative YouTube personality Mike Dice had a post about Rittenhouse taken down. The post didn’t praise Rittenhouse’s actions in allegedly killing the two men or say he wasn’t guilty, it merely pointed to a video where he’s providing aid to a demonstrator and posited that meant “he had no malicious intent by showing up” to the event. Dice tweeted about the removal on Tuesday. WARNING: The following video contains vulgar language that some viewers may find offensive: Rittenhouse shows him helping an injured protester after she was struck in the foot with a projectile,” Dice’s Aug. 28 Facebook post read. “In another video he told the cameraman that he brought a medical kit, which is the bag he was carrying. Further proving he had no malicious intent by showing up. In fact, he was there to help anyone who needed it.” Dice also posted these screen shots showing messages he had apparently received from Facebook, in which the social media giant claimed that he had violated its standards on “dangerous individuals and organizations” and that his “[p]age is at risk of being unpublished because of continued Community Standards violations.” There might be some question, if you’re reading this and somewhat familiar with Dice’s background, whether this was a case of specifically targeting Dice himself over Rittenhouse. In addition to his otherwise-vanilla YouTube videos, Dice has promoted conspiracy theories on the 9/11 attacks being an inside job, the 2015 Jade Helm 15 military exercises being a pretext for martial law in America and the Illuminati’s influence in the entertainment industry. Indeed, this would have been an easy out if Facebook wanted to equivocate. It didn’t. “We’ve designated the shooting in Kenosha a mass murder and are removing posts in support of the shooter, including this one,” a Facebook spokesman told Breitbart. Dice said he had been deliberately careful with what he posted about Rittenhouse, however, because he figured the 17-year-old been added to Facebook’s “dangerous individuals” list. You don’t necessarily have to be considered a murderer to be a “dangerous individual.” Others who’ve found their way onto the list include Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan and Milo Yiannopoulos, according to The Associated Press. “[The posts] were all very matter of fact about what happened. No praise, nor celebration, nothing like that because I figured that they added Kyle to the ‘dangerous individual’ [list],” Dice said. “I was very careful about what I posted.” This actually wasn’t news if you were looking, however. As early as Aug. 27, two days after the shooting, The Verge reported that searches for “Kyle Rittenhouse” were coming back blank on Facebook, including for details about the shootings. “It’s not actually new,” a Facebook representative told The Verge. “We block searches for a ton of stuff — for instance, child exploitation content.” Facebook had issued a previous statement, The Verge noted: “We’ve designated this shooting as a mass murder and have removed the shooter’s accounts from Facebook and Instagram.” Removing Rittenhouse’s accounts from Facebook and Instagram is a far cry from treating every instance of support for Rittenhouse as support for mass murder, however, particularly when the case hasn’t even moved to the plea stage. This goes beyond whether or not you find Rittenhouse to be a sympathetic figure or what you think of his motivations. If Facebook’s policy is taken to its logical conclusion, this means any time you post publicly about the Rittenhouse case and someone finds your post too skeptical of his guilt, it can be removed. This is a far cry from removing problematic or trollish posts about the shooting. There’s a question as to whether or not this is Facebook’s pendulum swinging in the opposite direction in the face of criticism. An Aug. 26 report from The Verge cited Facebook users who had complained about the Kenosha Guard, the so-called “militia” that organized a counterprotest in Kenosha — on the same night that Rittenhouse allegedly killed two men — in part via a Facebook event listing, and were told the group hadn’t violated any rules. There’s no evidence that the event listing had been viewed by Rittenhouse, but it generated more controversy on the left that Facebook wasn’t doing enough to combat elements on the fringe right. The response shouldn’t be the largest social media company on Earth declaring Rittenhouse’s guilt to be a fait accompli, however, thereby skipping the whole due process part. We know social media drives the cultural conversation on a whole panoply of topics. At a basic level, however, we should all agree it shouldn’t drive the conversation on a 17-year-old’s guilt or innocence, no matter what we may think of the case.
South Dakota Dismisses ‘Elite Class Of So-Called Experts,’ Carries On With State Fair After Sturgis Rally Fueled COVID-19 Surge | South Dakota is one of the nation’s hot spots for COVID-19 infections. That didn’t stop another large-scale event from kicking off Thursday. The rural South Dakota State Fair, which reported an attendance of 205,000 people last year, is set to run through Labor Day with more hand-washing stations, social distancing reminders and an encouragement — but not a requirement — for attendees to wear masks. It comes on the heels of the state’s two largest events: The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and the The Sioux Empire Fair. In the weeks following those events, South Dakota has emerged as a virus hotbed, according to data analysis. State and national health experts say the rise in cases is likely fueled by a combination of factors, including school reopenings, small gatherings and major events. Inside the numbers:The coronavirus spread is slowing in some states. It’s getting worse in others. Those larger events have been made possible by South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s steadfast resistance to restrictive measures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. She has discouraged schools from requiring masks, instead promoting hand-washing as the best way to prevent infections, and railed against an “elite class of so-called experts” whose opinions impact individuals’ liberties. But as cases surge in the state, public health officials are grappling with the impact of the Sturgis rally, which gained national attention as one of the largest events to be held since the onset of the pandemic. The event has so far been linked to one death. In South Dakota, 118 residents who attended the rally subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Nationally, about 300 cases have been linked to the rally. While that’s less than 1% of the more than 460,000 people who converged on Sturgis, Dr. Robert J. Kim-Farley said it’s likely “the tip of the iceberg.” Kim-Farley, a professor of epidemiology and community health sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told USA TODAY on Thursday that COVID-19 is a particularly difficult virus to trace to its infection point. Symptoms might not show up for weeks, if at all, in an infected person. Meanwhile, that person could be spreading the virus. Cellphone location data analyzed by the nonprofit COVID Alliance has found evidence that rally participants came from each of the 48 continental United States and more than half of the nation’s counties. The data also suggests participants were less likely to practice social distancing — they stayed at home less and traveled more compared to their neighbors. This behavior continued before and after the August rally, COVID Alliance data shows. Gov. Kristi Noem ‘remains focused on our hospitalization rate,’ not state’s case count While the rally’s impact ripples across the nation, a spike in cases in South Dakota is also gaining national attention. The Mount Rushmore State has recorded the nation’s third-highest rate of coronavirus cases per capita over the last two weeks, according to The Associated Press, and the highest per-capita rate in the nation for the past seven days, according to New York Times data. A statement from Noem’s office emailed to USA TODAY on Thursday says the Republican governor “remains focused on our hospitalization rate, and we are encouraged by the fact that only 6% of our ICU beds are currently occupied by COVID patients.” Mapping coronavirus:Tracking the U.S. outbreak While hospitalizations are a more accurate metric for studying COVID-19 spread than cases, there’s a lag time from days to weeks, Kim-Farley said. It’s “a little bit early to say that hospitalizations haven’t been affected,” Kim-Farley said. State epidemiologist Josh Clayton acknowledged there is typically a two-week lag between increases in cases and hospitalizations. Currently, less than 100 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, well within the state’s capacity. The pandemic and the surge of cases is impacting the state fair, Candi Briley, the event’s assistant manager, told USA TODAY. While organizers are “ready to welcome fairgoers” to Huron, about 125 miles northwest of Sioux Falls, they “understand some people might not feel comfortable coming out and we respect (their decision),” Briley said. For those who do, they’ll be encouraged to keep their distance. Among the reminders, according to Briley, are signs featuring pigs that read, “Have a squeal of a time at the fair. Stay 6 feet apart.”
People With Blood Type O More Protected Against COVID-19 – Studies | If a person with blood type A transmits the virus to a person with type O blood, the type O person will have antibodies that can fight the virus. People with blood type O have less of a chance of getting COVID-19, according to a number of studies published all over the world during the pandemic. But people with type A might be more vulnerable. After the pandemic broke out, one of the questions that scientists and doctors became puzzled by was why are some people more susceptible to contracting and even succumbing to the disease caused by coronavirus than others? Several studies have researched the link that genetics plays in susceptibility to contracting the virus, and some more specifically have linked the role played by blood type. The studies all came to a similar conclusion: People with blood type O have less of a chance of getting COVID-19. Two studies came out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, one that researched the link between blood type and COVID-19 susceptibility, and the other that investigated the link between blood type and the risk of contracting pneumonia caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 – the novel coronavirus. Another study came out of Italy and Spain, which looked into the link between genetics and SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure. But apparently the most popular, as well as most recent study is the ongoing research published by the personal genetics company 23andMe regarding evidence that blood type plays a role in COVID-19. 23andMe is a company that sends out personal genetics testing kits to individuals who are interested in finding out their genetic history and or their predisposition to certain genetically transmitted diseases such as certain types of cancer. According to the company’s blog, they did a study that contained more than 750,000 participants. Their preliminary data suggests that O blood type appears to be protective against the virus, and people with that type are between 9-18% less likely than other individuals to have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. But how does blood type actually play a role in infection? WHILE THE answer is not exactly known, Andre Franke, the lead scientist from the study done in Spain and Italy, suggested an answer to The New York Times. He noted that the gene region that codes for blood type is associated with elevated levels of key immune molecules. Their study included extracting DNA samples from 1,980 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized for respiratory failure. They scanned the samples using a rapid technique called genotyping, and looked at nearly nine million genetic letters. The researchers then carried out the same experiment on 2,205 blood donors with no evidence of COVID-19. They found that the ill patients shared a number of similar genetic variants compared to those who were not ill. The scientists were looking for spots in the genome called loci, which they ultimately found. The gene that determines blood type is in one of those spots. Their analysis showed a higher risk for A-positive individuals and a protective effect for blood group O. The researchers in Wuhan came to a similar conclusion. After eliminating other confounding risk factors such as age, gender and comorbidity, the team investigated and confirmed a connection between people with ABO blood groups and a risk of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients from three hospitals in Wuhan. In short, their findings also found that people with blood type A were at higher risk of hospitalization while O patients had the lowest risk. Other past research done in 2005 during the 2002 SARS epidemic supports the O blood type protection theory. Research at a Hong Kong hospital analyzed an infected patient who exposed 45 healthcare workers. Of 18 people with type blood O, 8 became infected (44%), compared to the other 27 people having other blood types, of whom 23 contracted the virus (85% – almost twice as much). BLOOD TYPE is determined by specific sugar molecules that are added to proteins or lipids on our blood cells and other cell types, according to Chemical Science and Engineering News. Those that are in the A blood type group carry A-sugar-antigens; the same goes for people with blood type B having B-antigens. But those with O blood type have neither. This means that the immune systems of people with type A blood develop antibodies for B antigens, people with type B blood have antibodies for A antigens, and people with type O blood have antibodies for both. Blood type influences blood clotting, and a growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 pathology often involves overactive blood clotting. People with type O blood have lower levels of proteins that promote blood clotting. SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in cells that express blood type antigens, Jacques Le Pendu, a glycobiologist at the University of Nantes told Chemical and Engineering News. This means that when an infected person coughs or sneezes, there’s a possibility that they release viral particles coated with their blood type antigens. Explained more in depth, a person in the blood type O group will have antibodies against virus transmission from someone in the blood type A group, which can fight the virus. However, a person in the blood type A group won’t have those same antibodies.
‘I Can’t Breathe,’ Man Tells Police, ‘I Don’t Care’, Cop Responds—Just Before The Man Dies | Oklahoma City, OK — The words ‘I can’t breathe’ have become a rallying cry for those who advocate for an end to police brutality. In case after gruesome case, these words are captured on video as cops squeeze the life from American citizens. Though police apologists will claim that saying “I can’t breathe” means you can breathe because you can talk, time after time, they are proven wrong. Although they were likely uttered countless times before, as cops squeezed the breath from their victims, the words “I can’t breathe” were burned into history when officer Daniel Pantaleo choked the last breath from Eric Garner. Showing their utter disregard for human life and the disturbing nature of the thin blue line culture, NYPD officers had shirts made that said, “I can breathe,” to mock the last words of a father of six, who they killed. Those words have been caught on film countless more times since that fateful day, yet they didn’t spark a major outcry until George Floyd uttered them on Memorial Day as cops squeezed the life from his body. Instances like Floyd’s happen so frequently that since that day, multiple body camera videos have been released showing cops doing the same thing to other folks, who die shortly after saying, “I can’t breathe.” Derrick Scott, 42, repeatedly told cops that he couldn’t breathe during his arrest last May, but cops couldn’t have cared less, and in fact, told this to Scott as he died. “I think that it was one of the most inhumane things that I have ever seen,” Vickey Scott, Derrick’s mother said. “They did not do anything for him. They treated him like he was an animal. He was trying to get his breath. He was trying to breathe, and they ignored him the whole time, like he was nothing. They even treat animals better than they treated my son. “It’s very hard,” she said. “I want every mother to watch that … and imagine that’s your son’s last so many minutes of life and he’s dying and they’re saying that he’s faking.” According to police, they were responding to a call of a black male in the area who allegedly brandished a gun during an argument. If Scott felt his life was threatened during this argument, he was entirely justified in brandishing a weapon. What’s more, he never fired it, and it appeared to resolve the situation — until police arrived. When officers arrived, they tackled Scott to the ground. Scott pleaded “I can’t breathe! Please! Help me! I can’t breathe,” as three Oklahoma City police officers pinned him to the ground with their knees and hands, removed the handgun from his pocket and held him there for about 13 minutes while waiting for paramedics to arrive. His death was eerily similar to that of George Floyd’s. “I can’t breathe,” Scott said as cops held their weight on top of him. “I don’t care,” one of the officers, Jarred Tipton, can be heard replying to Scott. “You can breathe just fine,” another officer can be heard saying later in the video. Scott would eventually fall unconscious and was transported to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy obtained by NBC News lists his cause of death as a collapsed lung. Oklahoma City police Capt. Larry Withrow said in a statement that an investigation into the incident by the Oklahoma County District Attorney’s Office cleared the three officers — Tipton, Ashley Copeland and Sgt. Jennifer Titus — of misconduct. Winthrow then claimed the “I don’t care (if you can breathe)” comment from Tipton was due to the “heat of a conflict.” “Certainly that may be something an officer says,” he told NBC affiliate KFOR. “Just understand — the officers are fighting with someone at that point.” But as the video below illustrates, Tipton was struggling with no one. Scott was prostrate on the ground, in handcuffs, barely moving, and begging for his life, surrounded by police officers. Scott’s uncle, Ronald Scott, told KFOR that he was “bothered by how they treated his life.” We agree.
WATCH: Protester Bleeds From His Ear After Being Shoved By Police — Cops Say He ‘Tripped’ | Video from Buffalo, New York was posted online on Thursday after a large group of police confronted a lone protester — and then violently shoved him. “Shortly after Buffalo’s curfew started, city police and State Police swept through the area of Niagara Square directly in front of City Hall to clear the area where a protest was finishing. An unidentified, older man was hit shoved by two officers in the line. The man lost his balance and fell to the pavement, audibly hitting his head with blood running out from under his head,” WBFO-TV reports. WKBW-TV’s Jeff Russo reports the Buffalo Police Department spokesperson claimed the man “was injured when he tripped and fell.” Russo disputed the claim. “We had a crew on the scene and after seeing video he clearly was pushed and stumbled backwards,” Russo reported.
Trump Considering A Move To Invoke Insurrection Act | President Donald Trump is considering invoking a 213-year-old federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty US troops to respond to protests in cities across the country, according to four people familiar with the internal White House discussions, according to NBC News. The article states that Trump has warmed to the idea of using the Insurrection Act, adopted in 1807, to deploy troops as his frustrations mount over the protests in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody last week in Minneapolis. "Some of the president’s aides have been encouraging him for days to invoke the act. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany left open the possibility that the president could invoke the Act. “The Insurrection Act, it’s one of the tools available, whether the president decides to pursue that, that’s his prerogative,“ McEnany said. Governors can request the federal government send active duty troops to help in cases of civil unrest like the widespread protests plaguing US cities. But, so far, no state governors have requested active duty troops to assist and instead have relied on local law enforcement and National Guard soldiers and airmen on state active duty. Governors often prefer the National Guard forces in these cases because they can legally perform law enforcement duties in the US, whereas troops on active duty cannot or they violate the Posse Comitatus Act."
How Does Coronavirus Kill? Clinicians Trace A Ferocious Rampage Through The Body, From Brain To Toes | On rounds in a 20-bed intensive care unit (ICU) one recent day, physician Joshua Denson assessed two patients with seizures, many with respiratory failure and others whose kidneys were on a dangerous downhill slide. Days earlier, his rounds had been interrupted as his team tried, and failed, to resuscitate a young woman whose heart had stopped. All shared one thing, says Denson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the Tulane University School of Medicine. “They are all COVID positive.” As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 surges past 2.2 million globally and deaths surpass 150,000, clinicians and pathologists are struggling to understand the damage wrought by the coronavirus as it tears through the body. They are realizing that although the lungs are ground zero, its reach can extend to many organs including the heart and blood vessels, kidneys, gut, and brain. “[The disease] can attack almost anything in the body with devastating consequences,” says cardiologist Harlan Krumholz of Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital, who is leading multiple efforts to gather clinical data on COVID-19. “Its ferocity is breathtaking and humbling.” Understanding the rampage could help the doctors on the front lines treat the fraction of infected people who become desperately and sometimes mysteriously ill. Does a dangerous, newly observed tendency to blood clotting transform some mild cases into life-threatening emergencies? Is an overzealous immune response behind the worst cases, suggesting treatment with immune-suppressing drugs could help? What explains the startlingly low blood oxygen that some physicians are reporting in patients who nonetheless are not gasping for breath? “Taking a systems approach may be beneficial as we start thinking about therapies,” says Nilam Mangalmurti, a pulmonary intensivist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). What follows is a snapshot of the fast-evolving understanding of how the virus attacks cells around the body, especially in the roughly 5% of patients who become critically ill. Despite the more than 1000 papers now spilling into journals and onto preprint servers every week, a clear picture is elusive, as the virus acts like no microbe humanity has ever seen. Without larger, prospective controlled studies that are only now being launched, scientists must pull information from small studies and case reports, often published at warp speed and not yet peer reviewed. “We need to keep a very open mind as this phenomenon goes forward,” says Nancy Reau, a liver transplant physician who has been treating COVID-19 patients at Rush University Medical Center. “We are still learning.” The infection begins When an infected person expels virus-laden droplets and someone else inhales them, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, enters the nose and throat. It finds a welcome home in the lining of the nose, according to a preprint from scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and elsewhere. They found that cells there are rich in a cell-surface receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Throughout the body, the presence of ACE2, which normally helps regulate blood pressure, marks tissues vulnerable to infection, because the virus requires that receptor to enter a cell. Once inside, the virus hijacks the cell’s machinery, making myriad copies of itself and invading new cells. As the virus multiplies, an infected person may shed copious amounts of it, especially during the first week or so. Symptoms may be absent at this point. Or the virus’ new victim may develop a fever, dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, or head and body aches. If the immune system doesn’t beat back SARS-CoV-2 during this initial phase, the virus then marches down the windpipe to attack the lungs, where it can turn deadly. The thinner, distant branches of the lung’s respiratory tree end in tiny air sacs called alveoli, each lined by a single layer of cells that are also rich in ACE2 receptors. Normally, oxygen crosses the alveoli into the capillaries, tiny blood vessels that lie beside the air sacs; the oxygen is then carried to the rest of the body. But as the immune system wars with the invader, the battle itself disrupts this healthy oxygen transfer. Front-line white blood cells release inflammatory molecules called chemokines, which in turn summon more immune cells that target and kill virus-infected cells, leaving a stew of fluid and dead cells—pus—behind. This is the underlying pathology of pneumonia, with its corresponding symptoms: coughing; fever; and rapid, shallow respiration. Some COVID-19 patients recover, sometimes with no more support than oxygen breathed in through nasal prongs. But others deteriorate, often quite suddenly, developing a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygen levels in their blood plummet and they struggle ever harder to breathe. On x-rays and computerized tomography scans, their lungs are riddled with white opacities where black space—air—should be. Commonly, these patients end up on ventilators. Many die. Autopsies show their alveoli became stuffed with fluid, white blood cells, mucus, and the detritus of destroyed lung cells (see graphic). An invader’s impactIn serious cases, SARS-CoV-2 lands in the lungs and can do deep damage there. But the virus, or the body’s response to it, can injure many other organs. Scientists are just beginning to probe the scope and nature of that harm. 8256734WindpipeBile ductBronchiiImmune cellsCapillaryBlood vesselEndothelial cellACE2SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoV-2ClotMucus12 LiverUp to half of hospitalized patients have enzyme levels that signal a struggling liver. An immune system in overdrive and drugs given to fight the virus may be causing the damage.7 NoseSome patients lose their sense of smell. Scientists speculate that the virus may move up the nose’s nerve endings and damage cells.6 EyesConjunctivitis, inflammation of the membrane that lines the front of the eye and inner eyelid, is more common in the sickest patients.3 KidneysKidney damage is common in severe cases and makes death more likely. The virus may attack the kidneys directly, or kidney failure may be part of whole-body events like plummeting blood pressure.4 IntestinesPatient reports and biopsy data suggest the virus can infect the lower gastrointestinal tract, which is rich in ACE2 receptors. Some 20% or more of patients have diarrhea.1 LungsA cross section shows immune cells crowding an inflamed alveolus, whose walls break down during attack by the virus, diminishing oxygen uptake. Patients cough, fevers rise, and it takes more and more effort to breathe.8 Heart and blood vesselsThe virus (green) enters cells, likely including those lining blood vessels, by binding to ACE2 receptors on the cell surface. Infection can also promote blood clots, heart attacks, and cardiac inflammation.5 BrainSome COVID-19 patients have strokes, seizures, mental confusion, and brain inflammation. Doctors are trying to understand which are directly caused by the virus. V. ALTOUNIAN/SCIENCE Some clinicians suspect the driving force in many gravely ill patients’ downhill trajectories is a disastrous overreaction of the immune system known as a “cytokine storm,” which other viral infections are known to trigger. Cytokines are chemical signaling molecules that guide a healthy immune response; but in a cytokine storm, levels of certain cytokines soar far beyond what’s needed, and immune cells start to attack healthy tissues. Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, and catastrophic organ failure can ensue. Some studies have shown elevated levels of these inflammation-inducing cytokines in the blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. “The real morbidity and mortality of this disease is probably driven by this out of proportion inflammatory response to the virus,” says Jamie Garfield, a pulmonologist who cares for COVID-19 patients at Temple University Hospital. But others aren’t convinced. “There seems to have been a quick move to associate COVID-19 with these hyperinflammatory states. I haven’t really seen convincing data that that is the case,” says Joseph Levitt, a pulmonary critical care physician at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He’s also worried that efforts to dampen a cytokine response could backfire. Several drugs targeting specific cytokines are in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. But Levitt fears those drugs may suppress the immune response that the body needs to fight off the virus. “There’s a real risk that we allow more viral replication,” Levitt says. Meanwhile, other scientists are zeroing in on an entirely different organ system that they say is driving some patients’ rapid deterioration: the heart and blood vessels. Striking the heart In Brescia, Italy, a 53-year-old woman walked into the emergency room of her local hospital with all the classic symptoms of a heart attack, including telltale signs in her electrocardiogram and high levels of a blood marker suggesting damaged cardiac muscles. Further tests showed cardiac swelling and scarring, and a left ventricle—normally the powerhouse chamber of the heart—so weak that it could only pump one-third its normal amount of blood. But when doctors injected dye in the coronary arteries, looking for the blockage that signifies a heart attack, they found none. Another test revealed why: The woman had COVID-19. How the virus attacks the heart and blood vessels is a mystery, but dozens of preprints and papers attest that such damage is common. A 25 March paper in JAMA Cardiology documented heart damage in nearly 20% of patients out of 416 hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In another Wuhan study, 44% of 138 hospitalized patients had arrhythmias. The disruption seems to extend to the blood itself. Among 184 COVID-19 patients in a Dutch ICU, 38% had blood that clotted abnormally, and almost one-third already had clots, according to a 10 April paper in Thrombosis Research. Blood clots can break apart and land in the lungs, blocking vital arteries—a condition known as pulmonary embolism, which has reportedly killed COVID-19 patients. Clots from arteries can also lodge in the brain, causing stroke. Many patients have “dramatically” high levels of D-dimer, a byproduct of blood clots, says Behnood Bikdeli, a cardiovascular medicine fellow at Columbia University Medical Center. “The more we look, the more likely it becomes that blood clots are a major player in the disease severity and mortality from COVID-19,” Bikdeli says. Infection may also lead to blood vessel constriction. Reports are emerging of ischemia in the fingers and toes—a reduction in blood flow that can lead to swollen, painful digits and tissue death. In the lungs, blood vessel constriction might help explain anecdotal reports of a perplexing phenomenon seen in pneumonia caused by COVID-19: Some patients have extremely low blood-oxygen levels and yet are not gasping for breath. It’s possible that at some stages of disease, the virus alters the delicate balance of hormones that help regulate blood pressure and constricts blood vessels going to the lungs. So oxygen uptake is impeded by constricted blood vessels, rather than by clogged alveoli. “One theory is that the virus affects the vascular biology and that’s why we see these really low oxygen levels,” Levitt says. If COVID-19 targets blood vessels, that could also help explain why patients with pre-existing damage to those vessels, for example from diabetes and high blood pressure, face higher risk of serious disease. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on hospitalized patients in 14 U.S. states found that about one-third had chronic lung disease—but nearly as many had diabetes, and fully half had pre-existing high blood pressure. Mangalmurti says she has been “shocked by the fact that we don’t have a huge number of asthmatics” or patients with other respiratory diseases in HUP’s ICU. “It’s very striking to us that risk factors seem to be vascular: diabetes, obesity, age, hypertension.” Scientists are struggling to understand exactly what causes the cardiovascular damage. The virus may directly attack the lining of the heart and blood vessels, which, like the nose and alveoli, are rich in ACE2 receptors. Or perhaps lack of oxygen, due to the chaos in the lungs, damages blood vessels. Or a cytokine storm could ravage the heart as it does other organs. “We’re still at the beginning,” Krumholz says. “We really don’t understand who is vulnerable, why some people are affected so severely, why it comes on so rapidly … and why it is so hard [for some] to recover.” Multiple battlefields The worldwide fears of ventilator shortages for failing lungs have received plenty of attention. Not so a scramble for another type of equipment: dialysis machines. “If these folks are not dying of lung failure, they’re dying of renal failure,” says neurologist Jennifer Frontera of New York University’s Langone Medical Center, which has treated thousands of COVID-19 patients. Her hospital is developing a dialysis protocol with different machines to support additional patients. The need for dialysis may be because the kidneys, abundantly endowed with ACE2 receptors, present another viral target. According to one preprint, 27% of 85 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had kidney failure. Another reported that 59% of nearly 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in and near Wuhan had protein and blood in their urine, suggesting kidney damage. Those with acute kidney injury (AKI), were more than five times as likely to die as COVID-19 patients without it, the same Chinese preprint reported. “The lung is the primary battle zone. But a fraction of the virus possibly attacks the kidney. And as on the real battlefield, if two places are being attacked at the same time, each place gets worse,” says Hongbo Jia, a neuroscientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’s Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology and a co-author of that study. Viral particles were identified in electron micrographs of kidneys from autopsies in one study, suggesting a direct viral attack. But kidney injury may also be collateral damage. Ventilators boost the risk of kidney damage, as do antiviral drugs including remdesivir, which is being deployed experimentally in COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storms also can dramatically reduce blood flow to the kidney, causing often-fatal damage. And pre-existing diseases like diabetes can boost the risk of AKI. “There is a whole bucket of people who already have some chronic kidney disease who are at higher risk for acute kidney injury,” says Suzanne Watnick, chief medical officer at Northwest Kidney Centers. Buffeting the brain Another striking set of symptoms in COVID-19 patients centers on the brain and central nervous system. Frontera says neurologists are needed to assess 5% to 10% of coronavirus patients at her hospital. But she says that “is probably a gross underestimate” of the number whose brains are struggling, especially because many are sedated and on ventilators. Frontera has seen patients with the brain inflammation encephalitis, with seizures, and with a “sympathetic storm,” an immune response that’s the brain’s version of a cytokine storm. Some people with COVID-19 briefly lose consciousness. Others have strokes. Many report losing their sense of smell. And Frontera and others wonder whether in some cases, infection depresses the brain stem reflex that senses oxygen starvation. This is another explanation for anecdotal observations that some patients aren’t gasping for air, despite dangerously low blood oxygen levels. ACE2 receptors are present in the neural cortex and brain stem, says Robert Stevens, an intensive care physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. But it’s not known under what circumstances the virus penetrates the brain and interacts with these receptors. That said, the coronavirus behind the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic—a close cousin of today’s culprit—could infiltrate neurons and sometimes caused encephalitis. On 3 April, a case study in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, from a team in Japan, reported traces of new coronavirus in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient who developed meningitis and encephalitis, suggesting it, too, can penetrate the central nervous system. But other factors could be damaging the brain. For example, a cytokine storm could cause brain swelling, and the blood’s exaggerated tendency to clot could trigger strokes. The challenge now is to shift from conjecture to confidence, at a time when staff are focused on saving lives, and even neurologic assessments like inducing the gag reflex or transporting patients for brain scans risk spreading the virus. Last month, Sherry Chou, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, began to organize a worldwide consortium that now includes 50 centers to draw neurological data from care patients already receive. The early goals are simple: Identify the prevalence of neurologic complications in hospitalized patients and document how they fare. Longer term, Chou and her colleagues hope to gather scans, lab tests, and other data to better understand the virus’ impact on the nervous system, including the brain.Chou speculates about a possible invasion route: through the nose, then upward and through the olfactory bulb—explaining reports of a loss of smell—which connects to the brain. “It’s a nice sounding theory,” she says. “We really have to go and prove that.” Most neurological symptoms “are reported from colleague to colleague by word of mouth,” Chou adds. “I don’t think anybody, and certainly not me, can say we’re experts.” Reaching the gut In early March, a 71-year-old Michigan woman returned from a Nile River cruise with bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Initially doctors suspected she had a common stomach bug, such as Salmonella. But after she developed a cough, doctors took a nasal swab and found her positive for the novel coronavirus. A stool sample positive for viral RNA, as well as signs of colon injury seen in an endoscopy, pointed to a gastrointestinal (GI) infection with the coronavirus, according to a paper posted online on in The American Journal of Gastroenterology (AJG). Her case adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting the new coronavirus, like its cousin SARS, can infect the lining of the lower digestive tract, where the crucial ACE2 receptors are abundant. Viral RNA has been found in as many as 53% of sampled patients’ stool samples. And in a paper in press at Gastroenterology, a Chinese team reported finding the virus’ protein shell in gastric, duodenal, and rectal cells in biopsies from a COVID-19 patient. “I think it probably does replicate in the gastrointestinal tract,” says Mary Estes, a virologist at Baylor College of Medicine. ecent reports suggest up to half of patients, averaging about 20% across studies, experience diarrhea, says Brennan Spiegel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, co–editor-in-chief of AJG. GI symptoms aren’t on CDC’s list of COVID-19 symptoms, which could cause some COVID-19 cases to go undetected, Spiegel and others say. “If you mainly have fever and diarrhea, you won’t be tested for COVID,” says Douglas Corley of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, co-editor of Gastroenterology. The presence of virus in the GI tract raises the unsettling possibility that it could be passed on through feces. But it’s not yet clear whether stool contains live, infectious virus, not just RNA and proteins. To date, “We have no evidence” that fecal transmission is important, says coronavirus expert Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa. CDC says that based on experiences with SARS and with the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, another dangerous cousin of the new coronavirus, the risk from fecal transmission is probably low. The intestines are not the end of the disease’s march through the body. For example, up to one-third of hospitalized patients develop conjunctivitis—pink, watery eyes—although it’s not clear that the virus directly invades the eye. Other reports suggest liver damage: More than half of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in two Chinese centers had elevated levels of enzymes indicating injury to the liver or bile ducts, according to two preprints. But several experts told Science that direct viral invasion isn’t likely the culprit. They say other events in a failing body, like drugs or an immune system in overdrive, are more likely driving the liver damage. This map of the devastation that COVID-19 can inflict on the body is still just a sketch. It will take years of painstaking research to sharpen the picture of its reach, and the cascade of cardiovascular and immune effects it might set in motion. As science races ahead, from probing tissues under microscopes to testing drugs on patients, the hope is for treatments more wily than the virus that has stopped the world in its tracks.
COVID Cases Surge Amid Growing Threat From Antimicrobial Resistance | “Across Europe and North America, hospitals and ICU units are filling up or are full”, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said at a regular press briefing in Geneva. While sharing “more good news from vaccine trials, which continues to give us hope of ending the pandemic”, he upheld the need to continue to “use the tools we have to interrupt the chains of transmission and save lives”. The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of the “intimate relationship between humans, animals and the planet we share”, the WHO chief said. “We cannot protect and promote human health without paying attention to the health of animals and the health of our environment”. This is particularly relevant when considering antimicrobial resistance, according to Tedros, who called it “one of the greatest health threats of our time”. Antimicrobial resistance threatens the efficacy of the antibiotics that are key in combatting HIV, malaria, neglected tropical diseases and many other illnesses. And while antimicrobial resistance may not seem as urgent as a pandemic, it is not only just as dangerous but threatens to “unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenseless against infections that today can be treated easily”, he warned. Combatting resistance Aligning with World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, which kicked off on Wednesday, the WHO chief launched a new report – along with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health  – that examines international rules governing antimicrobial practices, and identifies gaps in regulations governing their use on humans, animals and plants. The report, based on data from 136 countries, reveals that while almost 90 per cent of States have national action plans for antimicrobial resistance, only 20 per cent have identified funding for their implementation. “To help address that gap, together we have established a trust fund to support low and middle income countries to develop a truly ‘One Health’ approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance”, Tedros asserted, thanking Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom for $13 million in funding – the first round of support for eleven countries, and to generate more global coherence in their use. New leadership group Against the backdrop that increased political commitment at the highest levels of government was “one of the most important ways” to achieve that goal, the WHO chief announced the One Health Global Leaders Group, which will bring together prominent leaders from government, the private sector and civil society organizations “to advocate for urgent action to combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance”. It also involves participants from agriculture, health, development and other relevant areas “to maintain urgency, public support, political momentum and visibility of the antimicrobial resistance challenge”.
Lawsuit: Colorado Hispanic Teen Attacked By Police Dog In Mistaken Identity Case | 14-year-old Angel Nunez was playing outside with his sister when cops ordered a K-9 unit to rip his skin apart A newly filed lawsuit details how Colorado police sent a police dog to attack 14-year-old Angel Nunez on April 27, 2019. However, Nunez was not the shoplifting suspect police were looking for, police admitted that they thought Nunez was a fleeing suspect in a case of mistaken identity. Now the Nunez family has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Fort Lupton Police Department, The Firestone Police Department, and the Weld County Sheriff’s Department.The lawsuit was filed in 2020 and can be read here. https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/maven-user-documents/pinacnews/eye-on-government/8yaPggwKB0OVA46POK69GQ/eV1RqcqCJUa5CIELET0xMA/Angel-Nunez-Lawsuit.pdf Police were looking for a white male who had just led them on a high speed chase, after stealing beer and laundry detergent from a convenience store in Firestone, Colorado. KDVR News reports Nunez and his sister were playing outside of their residence when officers came running at them shouting that Nunez was the suspect and fit the description. An officer quickly tackled Nunez and other officers sent a police canine dog to attack and bite Nunez as he lay on the ground. Nunez’s parents quickly came outside and told the officers to stop because they had the wrong person. But the officers continued to let the dog bite into the legs of the innocent teenage Nunez. The police dog belonged to the Weld County Sheriff’s Department. The real suspect had ran into the direction of Nunez’s apartment complex, but got away. The suspect was a white male, with dark hair standing 5’9 to 5’10 wearing a black jacket, black pants and white shoes. The officers on scene finally realized that Nunez was not the white male suspect that they were looking for. One of the officers then mutes their body camera so his words could not be heard. Nunez got an infection from his bite wounds.
WATCH: Cop Gives No Warning Before Shooting 15yo Boy In The Back, Killing Him | Ceres, CA — Heart wrenching body camera footage was just released this week showing a Ceres police officer opening fire on a 15-year-old boy as he ran away. The officer dumped his entire magazine while aiming at the boy’s back, killing him for fleeing. Carmen “Spencer” Mendez was shot and killed in August 2018, however police have only just released the body camera footage publicly. The incident began during a car chase in a vehicle in which Mendez was a passenger. The chase ended with Mendez jumping out of the vehicle and fleeing on foot. Although the police were pursuing the vehicle over an alleged brandishing of a handgun, they were looking for a young man wearing a black shirt and jeans, according to records from Ceres. Mendez was wearing a white top and red pants. As the graphic video shows, Ceres police officer Ross Bays drives up behind the Lexus, gets out of his vehicle and opens fire on Mendez as the boy ran into an almond orchard. The officer gave no commands to the boy to even stop before he opens fire, killing him. Only after he dumped his entire magazine at the boy did the K-9 officer give any command. “Get on the ground,” he yelled at the teen who had collapsed in the orchard next to an almond sapling. Police would later claim that Mendez was armed with a gun. However, we can clearly see in the video that he was not pointing anything at the cop and although a gun was found at the scene, it was over five feet from the boy’s body. Despite a year passing since the shooting, and the horrifying video, the Stanislaus County district attorney’s office is still investigating and has not decided whether to file criminal charges against Bays. The civil process moved far more swifter and the family received a $2.1 million settlement earlier this year. According to the Modesto Bee: "Police Chief Richard Collins said in a Tuesday interview that he would not speak about the shooting until the Stanislaus County District Attorney’s office had concluded its review of the shooting. He said the district attorney’s office told him the shooting still is under review. Collins said his department’s internal affairs investigation is awaiting a final review. But Collins said he has been briefed, and the investigation found no violations of department policy." The chief went on to give the canned statement of how officers are often forced to make split-second decisions in which they cannot hesitate before dumping their entire magazine into the backs of fleeing teenage boys. “I will just say this (as a general statement),” Collins said. “We have to make split-second decisions based on situations, which are right then and there. It’s easy for anybody to come in and say, ‘I would do that, or this, or that looks horrible.’ But we were not in the officer’s shoes when it took place.” Modesto attorney Adam Stewart and Sacramento attorney Mark Merin, both represented the family in their civil suit. Even if the boy was holding a gun, they say Bays had many other non-lethal options at his disposal which were not used, up to and including telling the boy to surrender or stop. Bays could’ve also released his K-9, set up a perimeter, or any other number of less lethal tactics. “He was running away,” Stewart has said of Mendez, “fleeing the scene. At no time did he approach the officer.” As to why Bays shot first and gave commands second, his past could shed some light. Mendez was the second person killed by Bays in just a 10-month time frame. Bays shot and killed another man in the line of duty 10 months before killing Mendez, according to Merin. Merin said the city of Ceres reached a similar $2 million settlement with Nicholas Pimentel’s family after police killed him. The shooting death of Pimentel was ruled justified, which allowed Bays to go back onto the street to strike again. “What I get out of this is these officers are not trained, not disciplined, not corrected,” said Merin. “They’re not terminated after being involved in these kinds of killings. It shows a total lack of leadership, but it also shows a lack of reverence for human life.” We agree, this has to stop.
Carmelo Anthony Signs Multi-Year Deal With The Miami Heat | MIAMI, Florida – One of the most exciting players in the NBA, Carmelo Anthony, announced earlier today that he has signed a 3-year deal with The Miami Heat, hoping to replace the talent that Miami is losing after it was recently announced that their star player, LeBron James, would be leaving to become a free agent.  Anthony will be headed to a new city, on a new team, in attempts to do what he was trying to do with The Knicks – win a title. Since Anthony has been a free agent, a lot of different offers came his way, but The Heat found a way to lock him down for at least 3 years and people are excited about the move. Anthony was an all-star for the Knicks, and some would say that he was the golden horse of the organization. He had all the tools to be a champion player, besides a team that could follow suit. Anthony is very optimistic about things to come in Miami, and said believes he will be the player maker to make The Heat unstoppable. “Things just got a little hotter for The Heat.” said Anthony. “I’m excited to play for an organization that can finish strong, and win championships. I feel this squad should be called the fantastic four, we will be unstoppable.” During the interview, a reporter questioned Anthony’s Fantastic Four reference, seeing as how their would be 5 players on the court at once. “Listen, I don’t care about numbers or counting. It doesn’t even matter who is on the floor with me, they can just sit pretty anyway. I will win game-after-game anyway, with them or without them.” replied Anthony. Anthony is scheduled to report to South Beach in the next week to begin training with The Heat. He personally requested a new speedo, some sunblock, and a private chair on the beach for when he arrives.
Super Bowl 50 To Be Played in Ireland, NFL Fans Outraged | Belfast, Ireland – The location for the 2015 Super Bowl has been announced today and it is not receiving the applause that NFL officials thought it would. The next super bowl will be held in Belfast, Ireland, as a way to attempt to widen the fan base that the National Football League has in the world. Stunts like this have been done before, such as Notre Dame playing college football games in Ireland, and the ratings that came from those games were outstanding. The NFL has attempted the same approach, but with such a big game, and with many fans not able to travel to see it in person, people are not happy. “So I have to travel to a far away land to see a game that is already extremely expensive to watch?” Said Derek Paul, a fan who was planning on attending the Super Bowl this year for the first time. Reports speculate that their may be some hidden ties here that we are un aware of.  Geoff Silver, a commissioner of the NFL, also happens to have some businesses in Ireland, and rumors have surfaces, alleging he is doing this for sponsorships and more money. “I have heard the rumors and that is not the case.” Said Silver. “This has nothing to do with me. This was decision of the entire NFL committee as a whole.  We just want to broaden our horizons a bit, and have this special game somewhere besides the United States. On top of that, have you ever tried O’Malley Whiskey? It’s smooth as an Irish river and makes you feel like a warm summer day.” So far no sales or sponsorship has been made for this upcoming Super Bowl with the exception of one,  O’Malley Irish Whiskey. It is unclear at this time who the game will be played for live, as most Americans will not be able to afford the travel, and the Irish don’t generally follow American football.
Kim Jong-Un to Play for North Korean Soccer Team in World Cup | PYONGYANG, North Korea – The FIFA World Cup has officially kicked off, and teams are eager to represent their nations. Most politicians sit back and hope for the best for the team representing their country, but others are not as content to sit on the sidelines. Kim Jong-Un has announced that he will be taking the spot of goalie for the North Korean soccer team during their time in the World Cup. The announcement was  only made today, but tensions have already risen between Jong-Un and his new teammates. “I was told he would be on the team, and if we lost, we lost a finger.” Said a team member who wished to remain anonymous. “I am not sure how to play with that kind of stress.” It is unclear if Jong-un has any experience in the soccer world, but in the confidence department he is doing very well. “I will kick the ball, or grab it, or stop it. It should be simple. I am a very complex man, so this will be easy.” Said Jong-Un. “No one in North Korea would ever tell me no, so I do what I want, and I want to be a goalie.” Jong-Un is scheduled to play in North Korea’s next match, and fans of his in North Korea, as well as soccer fans in other countries, are anxious to see how his skills fare against the best players in the world. “I fear nothing, if a man wants to kick or throw his balls at me, I have no fear. I have taken harder hits in life, and this is a sport that I feel that I can dominant in.” Said Jong-Un. It has been reported that Jong-Un will be receiving the highest salary in the team’s history, and his other teammates have decided to take a pay cut to have him on the team. The pay cut was forced, but Jong-Un claims he is proud of his players for staying so modest.
World Cup Added To Olympics | Brasília, Brazil — It is official, the World Cup will soon be added to the Olympics. It will be run as it is, but as an Olympic event. So while your nations team is not only fighting for the World Cup Championship. They are fighting for those gold medals to help your nation win the Olympics. With the add of the world cup, the Olympics is also thinking of adding some solo based soccer events. This is going to be huge, these 2 great things added together is just going to be great. Olympics is where all the nations challenge each other over different skills. It is about time they add the worlds favorite sport. Below we have quotes from both the International Olympic Committee and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association “We are thrilled to have the World Cup added to our Olympics program. All the other soccer events we plan on adding , we feel is going to take us to the next level. The FIFA will still be running it, but it will be an Olympic event non the less.” – International Olympic Committee “Well there is nothing to lose here. We still get to run the show, while getting to be part of the Olympics. We feel this is a good move by both our programs. We have also been in the talks of being in charge of the other football events to be added to the Olympics.” – Internationale de Football Association Well you heard it all here folks. Watch out swimming, running, aerobic, and all you other Olympic events. Soccer is coming to steal that spotlight.
2016 Summer Olympics To Be Held In North Korea | Pyongyang, North Korea – The Olympics is a tourist jackpot that all countries throughout the world pray to be able to host. The location for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games was announced last week, with the Olympic committee choosing North Korea as host. North Korea President Kim Jong Un has told the press he is very excited to host the Olympics, but also plans to prevent any citizen from the United States from entering the country to participate. Not stopping at just the US though, Kim Jong Un has said he will completely close his borders throughout the games, making the Olympics only available to North Korea’s teams. Retired basketball player Dennis Rodman, who is a friend of Kim Jong Un’s, had recently tried talking him into re-opening the event to all countries, but negotiations were unsuccessful. Sources say Rodman actually made matters worse trying to talk Kim Jong Un, and it started a heated battle. The violent dictator reportedly felt threatened during his talk with Rodman, and took him as a hostage. The U.S. government decided not to respond to the hostage situation though, as President Barack Obama reiterated the U.S.’ standard position on not negotiating with terrorists. “Not to mention that [we] couldn’t care less if Dennis Rodman died.” Said Obama. As it looks as though there will be no progress made in forcing Kim Jong Un to reverse his decision and re-open the Olympics to all competitors, many teams from every corner of the globe are planning a protest to the Olympic committee directly, hoping to get them to have the games be hosted by another, more peaceful, country. “We are too afraid of Kim and what he might do if we change our minds and try to back out of having the games in his country.” Said Olympic committee chairman Richard Kimball. “We feel at this point it would just be best to let North Korea have this one, and we’ll try to pick a better location for the 2020 games. It’s probably the only chance they’ll ever have of winning medals anyway.”
UFC Added To The 2016 Rio Olympics | LAS VEGAS, Nevada- One of the fastest fan-growing sports is taking the next step in its journey. The UFC took storm with its fast-paced fights and knockouts, and now fans can be happy to hear that it will be the next sport to enter the Olympics. In a press conference over the weekend, the International Olympic Committee announced that Mixed Martial Arts will be added to the 2016 Olympics in Rio. At first, people weren’t considering the UFC as an actual sport, but more of a brutal backyard street fight with no composure. With years of competitive fight after fight, and even adding in a female chapter, the UFC has proved that they stand the test to be the next big Olympic sport. Fighters from all over the globe will be entering for their chance at a gold, silver, or bronze medal for their country. Ratings are expected to be huge in America, because we all know we would rather watch some guy from Turkey get his head slammed in by a guy from Russia than watch people dance around in a swimming pool. One fighter may have a leg up in this new arena –  Ronda Rousey has fought in the Olympics before, and has even won a medal for the United States. Something is telling us that she will bring home even more medals this next time around. Also, this news gives a second chance to Olympic athletes seeking an opportunity to compete for their country again. Not only will ex-boxers-turned-UFC fighters get a chance, but rumors of Michael Phelps taking the octagon have been hitting social media. Phelps tweeted: “I plan on returning to the Olympics, but not as a swimmer, as a fighter! #goforgold #winning #isfigthinghard? #Imkindofscared #Subway #EatFresh Several fighters have already stated their interest in fighting in the 2016 Rio Olympics for their respective countries, including George St Pierre, Jon Jones, and Kevin “Kimbo Slice” Ferguson.
Canadian Olympic Committee Fights To Make Full Contact Chess An Olympic Sport | MONTREAL, Québec— Former sex educator and Canadian Olympic Committee member Ivana Vulva has successfully lobbied for support of the COC in adding full contact chess to the Olympics. Vulva claims that chess has always been an unpopular sport dating back to high school for many Canadians. “It’s not fair,” stated the Montreal resident. “I’m trying to use my experience as a sex therapist to add some spice to a game I have always loved, but could rarely share.” The COC has been fully supportive of Vulva’s movement. Marcel Aubut, the Chairman of the committee, couldn’t say enough about the decision. “Ms. Vulva has taught me a lot that has enhanced my private life in a big way,” Aubut stated. “She has assisted in helping me to get in touch with my feminine side and showed me how I can use the strategic game playing of chess as a seductive tool to attract the opposite sex.” Vulva’s first step is to have chess brought into the international Olympic arena where it can be contested for Gold, Silver and Bronze medals. “There are a lot of us still in the closet when it comes to chess,” Vulva says. “It’s not so much an embarrassment of playing the game, either. I have found in my years as a sex therapist that many people who play chess have deeper issues they are suppressing and one of them is an extremely responsive libido.” The second phase of the plan is to see various adult-oriented competitions held where the full contact part of the game comes into play. “It’s not so much sexual and sensual,” Vulva explains. “I think it would be interesting to see what would take place between say, a Norwegian and Russian when engaged in full contact chess at the Olympic level.” Vulva was not clear on specific rules of the full-contact variation of the game but stated it is “not some sort of party game used to get girls drunk.” The COC will next lobby the International Olympic Committee to have chess added to a future Olympic games schedule.
Olympic Judge “Half Of These Rules Are Made Up” | SOCHI – After years of speculation from the average fan that there is no way somebody sat down and wrote down a set rule book for all these “dumb little sports” a 2014 Winter Games Judge, who asked us to keep his identity secret, has admitted that “a large portion, probably half of these rules are completely made up. Utter bullshit.” The judge also said that many times he has been asked to judge events he’d never heard of until hours before the event. “Christ, I remember get asked to judge that freaking biathlon, at first I’m thinking ‘Okay, just looks like a normal cross-country skiing type of thing seems normal enough’ and then they start pulling out weapons. I mean who thought that up? Who sat down and said hey skiing is fun and all but you know what it needs? Rifle shooting.” This came, surprisingly, as not much of a shock to the athletes. “Oh, I had my suspicions when on my scorecard somebody just wrote ‘really sweet spins, but your outfit doesn’t do much for your body,” said figure skater Annete Rogers of the United States, “hell, to be honest I barley know the rules. I’m out there dancing to a song on ice, you tell me how to score that.” But where does it stop? After digging a little farther I found out that it wasn’t just the judges and athletes who were clueless, it’s even found its way into the television booth reaching the announcers. An announcer from Men’s Slopestyle told our staff, “Have you heard some of the names I’m coming up with in the booth? You think there’s actual names for these things? No. I’m bucking for a hosting job on a new morning television show but instead I’m in this godforsaken country coming up with moves called the ‘McTwist’ and ‘Shredding the Gnar’ what does that even mean? Shredding the Gnar?” “Though it hasn’t quite been reduced to flipping a coin to determine the winner… it’s pretty damn close.” Said our anonymous Olympic Judge. “In a weird way, this should energize the fans, you know just as much, if not more than I do! Oh shit, I gotta run I’m due to judge the two-men bobseld finals. Haha, this should be a fun one.”
Aaron Hernandez Escapes From Prison During Routine Hospital Trip | Bristol County, Massachusetts – Ex-tight end and current felon Aaron Hernandez is on the run from the law, after managing to get past a prison guard while checked into a a local Massachusetts hospital earlier this week. Hernandez held a good spot on the New England Patriots before being charged with murder. He steadfastly proclaimed his innocence during the investigation, but with so much evidence pointing to the contrary, the jury found him guilty. It has been reported that Hernandez was complaining about stomach pains for months and begged security guards to take him to an actual hospital off prison grounds. After several weeks of hearing Hernandez cry in pain, they set up a date to visit a local hospital by the prison for a routine check up. While in the hospital Hernandez made his move and escaped the officers on the scene. Still on the loose, police are baffled to where he could be and how this even happened. “From my knowledge there was four officers watching him and he was cuffed to the bed. I don’t know how this happened” said the chief of Bristol County, Joseph Goldsmith. News of Hernandez being free has brought shock to people, but excitement for some die-hard Patriots fans. “I hope he is smart and gets some plastic surgery for his face. He could come back and play as someone completely different. We need him on the field, not in prison.” Said Archie Sellers, a die-hard Patriots fan. Reluctantly, the guard in charge of watching Hernandez during the hospital visit admitted what had actually happened, and how Hernandez was able to escape. “We were in a hospital not a prison, there was no bars to hold him back. He came at me fast did a studded step, then a swim move, and finished me with a stiff arm. He is fast as hell and looked like he was running for a hail mary pass as he flew out those hospital doors. By the time I got outside he was gone, nowhere to be seen.” Said the guard. Anyone with information on Hernandez’s whereabouts are encourage to contact their local police department.
LeBron Opens Up About Loss To Spurs, Reasons He Is Leaving Miami | MIAMI, Florida – After an extremely embarrassing loss to the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, you can’t blame LeBron if he wants to leave The Heat. It has been reported that James will opt out of his contract and become a free agent. He has been with the Heat for several years after leaving Cleveland, and on paper he has nothing but a flawless career with Miami. This year, the NBA finals made the normally powerhouse Heat look like rookies, even though they had a roster other teams can only dream of. In a private interview, James admitted why they lost to the Spurs, and the reason behind his choosing to leave the Heat. “Well, obviously things didn’t go the way we wanted.” said James. “I’m not trying to take anything away from the Spurs or their organization here, but that was a series that should have gone a lot differently. I have never been so embarrassed in my life.” James seemed no embarrassment in blaming everyone else on the team, taking absolutely no responsibility for any issues throughout their games with San Antonio. “If my team played the way I told them to, then we would have won, no doubt in my mind. Not to mention if the entire organization had listened. No one heard a damn thing I said. They never hydrated me the right way, they even gave me Midol for my cramps – I’m not even kidding? On top of that, they never had the right sized headbands. They just pretended I wasn’t there, apparently. So maybe I just won’t be next time.” It is unknown where LeBron will land come next season, but he has made it clear he is looking for a team that will listen to every one of his ideas, and take them as gospel. “Any team in the NBA should be absolutely honored to have me on their team.” Said LeBron. “If there is a greatest player still working today, it’s got to be me. Next year, my new team will get me some damn headbands that fit.”

First Ever Neo-Nazi Pride Parade Was A Huge Success! | Pride month has been exciting with many global companies showing their support from Microsoft to Chik-Fil-A, but the biggest surprise has been the first ever Neo-Nazi Pride parade and the new LGBT swastika logo. The parade comes as no surprise after a new study by the University of Dickinbut revealed 80% of neo-nazi men are likely attracted to other men.

New Scientific Study Suggests Marijuana Could Lead To Homosexuality | UNITED STATES – A scientific study by Dr. Dicken Mybutt suggests that not only does marijuana affect a person’s sexual experience but could lead to homosexuality. He claims his new study found that men who smoked marijuana were more likely to find other men attractive. Dr. Dicken Mybutt began his study on marijuana use and its side effects after he lost his wallet and had no money to pay his drug dealer. His drug dealer made him a deal, and he found himself giving his drug dealer oral sex. Dr. Dicken Mybutt claims to be a heterosexual man and believes that marijuana played a significant role in his actions. The study conducted at UTIG University used 50 heterosexual men who never smoked marijuana. Before smoking marijuana, the 50 men watched gay pronographic videos and photos to which they found discomforting. After two weeks, the men watched more gay videos and photos, and they showed no signs of discomfort. He concluded that marijuana made men more comfortable with homosexual activity.
Billboard Agrees To Reinstate Lil Nas X’s ‘Old Town Road’ To The Country Charts But “Only Because Of Billy Ray Cyrus” | NATIONWIDE – 1 week after Billboard removed Lil Nas X’s ‘Old Town Road’ from the country charts for being “not country enough”, they have announced they will be reinstating Old Town Road and Old Town Road Remix, which features country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, back onto the country charts, but only “because of Billy”. After Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road became an internet sensation thanks to apps like Twitter and Tik Tok, it has since become number 1 on Apple Music, number 1 on Spotify, and currently peaking at number 15 on the Billbord hot 100. After its debate of being rap or country, Billboard decided to take the song off the country charts, sparking backlash against billboard with many claiming it was because of Lil Nas X’s race. However, Billy Ray Cyrus’ feature on the remix is apparently enough for it to be country. “We’re adding it back” said Billboard spokesperson Jerry Faulkner, “we’re only adding back Old Town Road because Billy Ray Cyrus is one of my favorite singers, otherwise we would still have said no because he doesn’t look like a country person to me.” Although not admitting it being because Lil Nas X is black, it seems as though it is the actual reason. “My damn daughter keeps playing that song at home i’m tired of it, I always tell her to shut that black music up”, said Faulkner.

NFL Security Takes Record-Long Time To Catch Beautiful Woman Streaking Saints/Rams Game | NEW ORLEANS, LA –It was an explosive matchup between the Saints and Rams this Sunday. But perhaps the most exciting moment came between the whistles, when a voluptuous and positively beautiful woman stormed the field in nothing but her birthday suit. In the opinion of this reporter, this woman was an absolute fox. I mean.. Goddamn. While the woman pranced around the field in slow-motion Baywatch fashion, NFL security inexplicably could not catch her for a full 45 minutes. The team tried corralling her from all angles as some security members preferred chasing from behind and others preferred the front. A few guards were seen filming the chase on their phones, a practice that the league later defended as “standard protocol.” The woman was eventually pinned down by Rams cornerback Marcus Peters, who proceeded to spread rose petals around her, light a scented candle, and play Sisqó music from a portable speaker. Peters noted that he always has a go-bag ready for such occasions. The crowd did not seem to mind the delay, as the 75,000 fans in attendance were on their feet and cheering on the beautiful woman. However, most male fans remained seated for the remainder of the game once the chase ended.
‘Bird Box’ Challenge: Man Crashes After Attempting To Drive Blindfolded | AUSTIN, TX – A 20 year old man is being hospitalized in serious condition after being involved in an automobile accident. According to witnesses, the man was driving while blindfolded. Authorities say the man was attempting the “Bird Box challenge”, a challenge that consists of attempting every day tasks while blindfolded, in this case driving a car. Jacob, 20, is currently being hospitalized at Austin state hospital after being involved in a serious 4 vehicle accident. All others involved in the accident walked away with minor cuts and bruises. Jacob was attempting to drive his car down 45th street blindfolded thanks to the latest internet challenge called the “Bird Box challenge”. ‘Bird Box’ is the title of a recently released Netflix horror film in which characters in the movie must be blindfolded to not be “possessed” by the evil spirits, thus the characters had to do everyday activities blindfolded. “Natural selection”, says Nurse Dennis Seyih, “this is darwinism at it’s finest hour” he finished, referring to Jacob. Experts are actually encouraging people to partake in this one-of-many dangerous internet challenges that have emerged in recent years. “We need more people like Jacob to do these types of challenges so our world can be rid of idiots”, said human behavior expert Joan Chelsea. Jacob is expected to recover in a few weeks, and will also face criminal charges for reckless endangerment while driving.
Government Shutdown Means No Tax Refunds And No Income Tax Flexing! | For many Americans, income tax flexing is a the most important time of the year, and the people who tend to file early in the season are taxpayers who count on large refunds to pay for rims, buy new fits or just flex money social media” Reyes wrote. This all comes during a year when many American taxpayers should be expecting bigger refunds than normal under the new GOP tax law that went into effect in 2018. An analysis by UBS estimated an increase in overall tax refunds of between $42 billion and $66 billion this year. We spoke to Erica about the situation and she screamed and yelled “FUCK TRUMP!” she was planning on using her refund to buy a baby giraffe. The bank found that most married filers with two children would see the biggest boost in their refunds for 2018, compared with 2017, particularly those making between $125,000 and $400,000 and those making under $40,000 a year.
We Are at War | We are at war. Yes. And I don’t mean the West against the East, against Russia and China, nor the entire world against an invisible corona virus. No. We, the common people, are at war against an ever more authoritarian and tyrannical elitist Globalist system, reigned by a small group of multi-billionaires, that planned already decades ago to take power over the people, to control them, reduce them to what a minute elite believes is an “adequate number” to inhabit Mother Earth – and to digitize and robotize the rest of the survivors, as a sort of serfs. It’s a combination of George Orwell’s “1984” and Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World”. Welcome to the age of the transhumans. If we allow it. Vaccination That’s why vaccination is needed in warp speed, to inject us with transgenic substances that may change our DNA, lest we may wake up, or at least a critical mass may become conscious – and change the dynamics. Because dynamics are not predictable, especially not in the long-term. The war is real and the sooner we all realize it, the sooner those in masks and those in social distancing take cognizance of the worldwide “anti-human” dystopian situations we have allowed our governments to bestow on us, the better our chance to retake our sovereign selves. Today we are confronted with totally illegal and oppressive rules, all imposed under the pretext of “health protection”. Non-obedience is punishable by huge fines; military and police enforced rules: Mask wearing, social distancing, keeping within the allowed radius of our “homes”, quarantining, staying away from our friends and families. Actually, the sooner, We, the People, will take up an old forgotten characteristic of human kind – “solidarity” – and fight this war with our solidarity, with our love for each other, for mankind, with our love for LIFE and our Love for Mother Earth, the sooner we become again independent, self-assured beings, an attribute we have lost gradually over the last decades, at the latest since the beginning of the neoliberal onslaught of the 1980s. Slice by tiny slice of human rights and civil rights have been cut off under false pretexts and propaganda – “security” – to the point where we, drowned in propagated dangers of all kinds, begged for more security and gladly gave away more of our freedoms and rights. How sad. Now, the salami has been sliced away. We suddenly realize, there is nothing left. Its irrecoverable. We have allowed it to happen before our eyes, for promised comfort and propaganda lies by these small groups of elitists – by the Globalists, in their thirst for endless power and endless greed – and endless enlargements of their riches, of their billions. – Are billions of any monetary union “riches”? – Doubtfully. They have no love. No soul, no heart just a mechanical blood-pump that keeps them alive, if you can call that a “life”. These people, the Globalists, they have sunk so deep in their moral dysfunction, totally devoid of ethics, that their time has come – either to be judged against international human rights standards, war crimes and crimes against humanity – similar as was done by the Nuremberg Trials after World War II, or to disappear, blinded away by a new epoch of Light. As the number of awakening people is increasing, the western Powers that Be (PTB) are becoming increasingly nervous and spare no efforts coercing all kinds of people, para-government, administrative staff, medical personnel, even independent medical doctors into defending and promoting the official narrative. It is so obvious, when you have known these people in “normal” times, their progressive opinions suddenly turning, by 180 degrees, to the official narrative, defending the government lies, the lies of the bought “scientific Task Forces” that “advise” the governments, and thereby provide governments with alibis to “tighten the screws” a bit more (Ms. Merkel’s remarks) around the people, the very people the governments should defend and work for; the lies and deceptive messages coming from “scientists” who may have been promised “eternal, endless ladders of careers”, or of lives in a hidden paradise? What more may they get in turn for trying to subvert their friends’, peers’, patients’ opinions about the horror disease “covid-19”? – Possibly something that is as good as life itself – and is basically cost free for the avaricious rich. For example, a vax-certificate without having been vaxxed by the toxic injections, maybe by a placebo – opening the world of travel and pleasurable activities to them as “before”. By the way, has anybody noticed that in this 2020 / 2021 winter flu-season, the flu has all but disappeared? – Why? – It has conveniently been folded into covid, to fatten and exaggerate the covid statistics. It’s a must, dictated by the Globalists, the “invisible” top echelon, whose names may not be pronounced. Governments have to comply with “covid quotas”, in order to survive the hammer of the Globalists. Other special benefits for those selected and complacent defender of the official narrative, the placebo-vaxxed, may include dispensation from social distancing, mask wearing, quarantining – and who knows, a hefty monetary award. Nothing would be surprising, when you see how this tiny evil cell is growing like a cancer to take over full power of the world – including and especially Russia and China, where the bulk of the world’s natural resources are buried, and where technological and economic advances far outrank the greed-economy of the west. They will not succeed. What if the peons don’t behave? – Job loss, withdrawal of medical licenses, physical threats to families and loved ones, and more. The Globalists evil actions and influence-peddling is hitting a wall in the East, where they are confronted with educated and awakened people. We are at war. Indeed. The 99.999% against the 0.001%. Their tactics are dividing to conquer, accompanied by this latest brilliant idea – launching an invisible enemy, a virus, a plandemic, and a fear campaign to oppress and tyrannize the entire world, all 193 UN member countries. The infamous words, spoken already more than half a century ago by Rockefeller protégé, Henry Kissinger, comes to mind: “Who controls food supply controls the people; who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.” Quoted below are some lines and thoughts of a 1 January 2021, RT Op-Ed article by Helen Buyniski entitled “Civil war, medical discrimination, spy satellites and cyborgs! How 2021 could make us yearn for 2020”. The article may point us in a direction of what may happen in 2021, that we certainly do not yearn for: “People everywhere are eager to bid farewell to 2020, a year in which our lives were turned upside down by power-mad elites who seized the Covid-19 pandemic as a chance to go full police state. But be careful what you wish for…. merely putting up a new calendar does nothing to address [the mounting repression and tyranny], which seem certain to reach a breaking point. Humanity has been pushed to the limit with arbitrary rules, enforced poverty, and mandated isolation — it will only take a spark or two for things to explode.” And it continues – ”As vaccines are rolled out to the general public, the divide between those obeying the rules and the dissidents will only grow. Those who decline to get the jab will be treated as pariahs, banned from some public spaces and told it’s their fault life hasn’t gone back to normal, just as so-called “anti-maskers” have been.” And more glorious prospects “Anyone who isn’t thrilled by the idea of ingesting an experimental compound whose makers have been indemnified from any lawsuits, will be deemed an enemy of the state, even separated from their children or removed from their home as a health risk. Neighbors will gleefully rat each other out for the equivalent of an extra chocolate ration, meaning even the most slavishly obedient individuals could end up in “quarncentration camps” for upsetting the wrong person.” Yes, we are in the midst of war. A war that has already ravaged our society, divided it all the way down to families and friends. If we are not careful, we may not look our children and grandchildren in the eyes, because we knew, we ought to have known what was and is going on, what is being done, by a small dark power elite – the Globalists. We must step out of our comfort zone, and confront the enemy with an awakened mind of consciousness and a heart filled with love – but also with fierce resistance. If we fail to step up and stand up for our rights, this war goes on to prepare future generations – to abstain from congregating with other people. They are already indoctrinating our kids into keeping away from friends, school colleagues, peers, and from playing in groups with each other – as the New Normal. The self-declared cupula – the crème of the crop of civilization – the Globalist evil masters, already compromised and continue to do so, the education systems throughout the globe to instill into kids and young adults that wearing masks is essential for survival, and “social distancing” is the only way forward. Breaking the Social Fabric. Towards Totalitarian Rule They, the Globalists, know damned well that once a civilization has lost its natural cohesion – the social fabric is broken, the very fabric that keeps a civilization together and dynamically advancing, they have won the battle. Maybe not the war, since the war will last as long as there is resistance. The “dynamic advancing” – or simply dynamics itself – is their nightmare, because dynamics is what makes life tick – life, people, societies, entire nations and continents. Without dynamics life on the planet would stand still. And that’s what they want – a Globalist dictator, controlling a small population of serfs, or robotized slaves, that move only when told, own nothing and are given a digital blockchain controlled universal income, that, depending on their behavior and obedience, they may use to buy food, pleasure and comfort. Once the slaves are dispensable or incorrigible, their electronically controlled brains are simply turned off – RIP. This may turn out to be the most devastating war mankind has ever fought. May We, the People, see through this horrendous sham which is already now playing out, in Year One of the UN Agenda 21 /30; And may We, the People, the commons, win this war against a power-thirsty elite and its bought administrators and “scientists” throughout the world – and restore a sovereign, unmasked, socially coherent society – in solidarity.
The COVID-19 RT-PCR Test: How to Mislead All Humanity. Using a “Test” To Lock Down Society | It is time for everyone to come out of this negative trance, this collective hysteria, because famine, poverty, massive unemployment will kill, mow down many more people than SARS-CoV-2! Introduction: using a technique to lock down society All current propaganda on the COVID-19 pandemic is based on an assumption that is considered obvious, true and no longer questioned: Positive RT-PCR test means being sick with COVID. This assumption is misleading. Very few people, including doctors, understand how a PCR test works. RT-PCR means Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction. In French, it means: Réaction de Polymérisation en Chaîne en Temps Réel. In medicine, we use this tool mainly to diagnose a viral infection. Starting from a clinical situation with the presence or absence of particular symptoms in a patient, we consider different diagnoses based on tests. In the case of certain infections, particularly viral infections, we use the RT-PCR technique to confirm a diagnostic hypothesis suggested by a clinical picture. We do not routinely perform RT-PCR on any patient who is overheated, coughing or has an inflammatory syndrome! It is a laboratory, molecular biology technique of gene amplification because it looks for gene traces (DNA or RNA) by amplifying them. In addition to medicine, other fields of application are genetics, research, industry and forensics. The technique is carried out in a specialized laboratory, it cannot be done in any laboratory, even a hospital. This entails a certain cost, and a delay sometimes of several days between the sample and the result. Today, since the emergence of the new disease called COVID-19 (COrona VIrus Disease-2019), the RT-PCR diagnostic technique is used to define positive cases, confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus responsible for the new acute respiratory distress syndrome called COVID-19). These positive cases are assimilated to COVID-19 cases, some of whom are hospitalized or even admitted to intensive care units. Official postulate of our managers: positive RT-PCR cases = COVID-19 patients. [1] This is the starting postulate, the premise of all official propaganda, which justifies all restrictive government measures: isolation, confinement, quarantine, mandatory masks, color codes by country and travel bans, tracking, social distances in companies, stores and even, even more importantly, in schools [2]. This misuse of RT-PCR technique is used as a relentless and intentional strategy by some governments, supported by scientific safety councils and by the dominant media, to justify excessive measures such as the violation of a large number of constitutional rights, the destruction of the economy with the bankruptcy of entire active sectors of society, the degradation of living conditions for a large number of ordinary citizens, under the pretext of a pandemic based on a number of positive RT-PCR tests, and not on a real number of patients. Technical aspects: to better understand and not be manipulated The PCR technique was developed by chemist Kary B. Mullis in 1986. Kary Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993. Although this is disputed [3], Kary Mullis himself is said to have criticized the interest of PCR as a diagnostic tool for an infection, especially a viral one. He stated that if PCR was a good tool for research, it was a very bad tool in medicine, in the clinic [4]. Mullis was referring to the AIDS virus (HIV retrovirus or HIV) [5], before the COVID-19 pandemic, but this opinion on the limitation of the technique in viral infections [6], by its creator, cannot be dismissed out of hand; it must be taken into account! PCR was perfected in 1992. As the analysis can be performed in real time, continuously, it becomes RT (Real-Time) – PCR, even more efficient. It can be done from any molecule, including those of the living, the nucleic acids that make up the genes: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) Viruses are not considered as “living” beings, they are packets of information (DNA or RNA) forming a genome. It is by an amplification technique (multiplication) that the molecule sought is highlighted and this point is very important. RT-PCR is an amplification technique [7]. If there is DNA or RNA of the desired element in a sample, it is not identifiable as such. This DNA or RNA must be amplified (multiplied) a certain number of times, sometimes a very large number of times, before it can be detected. From a minute trace, up to billions of copies of a specific sample can be obtained, but this does not mean that there is all that amount in the organism being tested. In the case of COVID-19, the element sought by RT-PCR is SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus [8]. There are DNA viruses such as Herpes and Varicella viruses. The most well known RNA viruses, in addition to coronaviruses, are Influenza, Measles, EBOLA, ZIKA viruses. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, RNA virus, an additional specific step is required, a transcription of RNA into DNA by means of an enzyme, Reverse Transcriptase. This step precedes the amplification phase. It is not the whole virus that is identified, but sequences of its viral genome. This does not mean that this gene sequence, a fragment of the virus, is not specific to the virus being sought, but it is an important nuance nonetheless: RT-PCR does not reveal any virus, but only parts, specific gene sequences of the virus. At the beginning of the year, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced. It consists of about 30,000 base pairs. The nucleic acid (DNA-RNA), the component of the genes, is a sequence of bases. In comparison, the human genome has more than 3 billion base pairs. Teams are continuously monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome as it evolves [9-10-11], through the mutations it undergoes. Today, there are many variants [12]. By taking a few specific genes from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, it is possible to initiate RT-PCR on a sample from the respiratory tract. For COVID-19 disease, which has a nasopharyngeal (nose) and oropharyngeal (mouth) entry point, the sample should be taken from the upper respiratory tract as deeply as possible in order to avoid contamination by saliva in particular. The Gold Standard (preferred site for sampling) is the nasopharyngeal (nasal) approach, the most painful route.If there is a contraindication to the nasal approach, or preferably to the individual being tested, depending on the official organs, the oropharyngeal approach (through the mouth) is also acceptable. The test may trigger a nausea/vomiting reflex in the individual being tested. Normally, for the result of an RT-PCR test to be considered reliable, amplification from 3 different genes (primers) of the virus under investigation is required. “The primers are single-stranded DNA sequences specific to the virus. They guarantee the specificity of the amplification reaction. » [14] “The first test developed at La Charité in Berlin by Dr. Victor Corman and his associates in January 2020 allows to highlight the RNA sequences present in 3 genes of the virus called E, RdRp and N. To know if the sequences of these genes are present in the RNA samples collected, it is necessary to amplify the sequences of these 3 genes in order to obtain a signal sufficient for their detection and quantification. »[15]. The essential notion of Cycle Time or Cycle Threshold or Ct positivity threshold [16]. An RT-PCR test is negative (no traces of the desired element) or positive (presence of traces of the desired element). However, even if the desired element is present in a minute, negligible quantity, the principle of RT-PCR is to be able to finally highlight it by continuing the amplification cycles as much as necessary. RT-PCR can push up to 60 amplification cycles, or even more! Here is how it works: Cycle 1: target x 2 (2 copies) Cycle 2: target x 4 (4 copies) Cycle 3: target x 8 (8 copies) Cycle 4: target x 16 (16 copies) Cycle 5; target x 32 (32 copies) Etc exponentially up to 40 to 60 cycles! When we say that the Ct (Cycle Time or Cycle Threshold or RT-PCR positivity threshold) is equal to 40, it means that the laboratory has used 40 amplification cycles, i.e. obtained 240 copies. This is what underlies the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay. While it is true that in medicine we like to have high specificity and sensitivity of the tests to avoid false positives and false negatives, in the case of COVID-19 disease, this hypersensitivity of the RT-PCR test caused by the number of amplification cycles used has backfired. This over-sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is deleterious and misleading! It detaches us from the medical reality which must remain based on the real clinical state of the person: is the person ill, does he or she have symptoms? That is the most important thing! As I said at the beginning of the article, in medicine we always start from the person: we examine him/her, we collect his/her symptoms (complaints-anamnesis) and objective clinical signs (examination) and on the basis of a clinical reflection in which scientific knowledge and experience intervene, we make diagnostic hypotheses. Only then do we prescribe the most appropriate tests, based on this clinical reflection. We constantly compare the test results with the patient’s clinical condition (symptoms and signs), which takes precedence over everything else when it comes to our decisions and treatments. Today, our governments, supported by their scientific safety advice, are making us do the opposite and put the test first, followed by a clinical reflection necessarily influenced by this prior test, whose weaknesses we have just seen, particularly its hypersensitivity. None of my clinical colleagues can contradict me. Apart from very special cases such as genetic screening for certain categories of populations (age groups, sex) and certain cancers or family genetic diseases, we always work in this direction: from the person (symptoms, signs) to the appropriate tests, never the other way around. This is the conclusion of an article in the Swiss Medical Journal (RMS) published in 2007, written by doctors Katia Jaton and Gilbert Greub microbiologists from the University of Lausanne : PCR in microbiology: from DNA amplification to result interpretation: “To interpret the result of a PCR, it is essential that clinicians and microbiologists share their experiences, so that the analytical and clinical levels of interpretation can be combined.” It would be indefensible to give everyone an electrocardiogram to screen everyone who might have a heart attack one day. On the other hand, in certain clinical contexts or on the basis of specific evocative symptoms, there, yes, an electrocardiogram can be beneficial. Back to RT-PCR and Ct (Cycle Time or Cycle Threshold). In the case of an infectious disease, especially a viral one, the notion of contagiousness is another important element. Since some scientific circles consider that an asymptomatic person can transmit the virus, they believe it is important to test for the presence of virus, even if the person is asymptomatic, thus extending the indication of RT-PCR to everyone. Are RT-PCR tests good tests for contagiousness? [17] This question brings us back to the notion of viral load and therefore Ct. The relationship between contagiousness and viral load is disputed by some people [18] and no formal proof, to date, allows us to make a decision. However, common sense gives obvious credence to the notion that the more virus a person has inside him or her, especially in the upper airways (oropharynx and nasopharynx), with symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, the higher the risk of contagiousness, proportional to the viral load and the importance of the person’s symptoms. This is called common sense, and although modern medicine has benefited greatly from the contribution of science through statistics and Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), it is still based primarily on common sense, experience and empiricism. Medicine is the art of healing. No test measures the amount of virus in the sample! RT-PCR is qualitative: positive (presence of the virus) or negative (absence of the virus). This notion of quantity, therefore of viral load, can be estimated indirectly by the number of amplification cycles (Ct) used to highlight the virus sought. The lower the Ct used to detect the virus fragment, the higher the viral load is considered to be (high). The higher the Ct used to detect the virus fragment, the lower the viral load is considered to be (low). Thus, the French National Reference Centre (CNR), in the acute phase of the pandemic, estimated that the peak of viral shedding occurred at the onset of symptoms, with an amount of virus corresponding to approximately 108 (100 million) copies of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on average (French COVID-19 cohort data) with a variable duration of shedding in the upper airways (from 5 days to more than 5 weeks) [19]. This number of 108 (100 million) copies/μl corresponds to a very low Ct. A Ct of 32 corresponds to 10-15 copies/μl. A Ct of 35 corresponds to about 1 copy/μl. Above Ct 35, it becomes impossible to isolate a complete virus sequence and culture it! In France and in most countries, Ct levels above 35, even 40, are still used even today! The French Society of Microbiology (SFM) issued an opinion on September 25, 2020 in which it does not recommend quantitative results, and it recommends to make positive up to a Ct of 37 for a single gene [20]! With 1 copy/μl of a sample (Ct 35), without cough, without symptoms, one can understand why all these doctors and scientists say that a positive RT-PCR test means nothing, nothing at all in terms of medicine and clinic! Positive RT-PCR tests, without any mention of Ct or its relation to the presence or absence of symptoms, are used as is by our governments as the exclusive argument to apply and justify their policy of severity, austerity, isolation and aggression of our freedoms, with the impossibility to travel, to meet, to live normally! There is no medical justification for these decisions, for these governmental choices! In an article published on the website of the New York Times (NYT) on Saturday, August 29, American experts from Harvard University are surprised that RT-PCR tests as practiced can serve as tests of contagiousness, even more so as evidence of pandemic progression in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection [21]. The Covid-19 Numbers Game: The “Second Wave” is Based on Fake Statistics According to them, the threshold (Ct) considered results in positive diagnoses in people who do not represent any risk of transmitting the virus! The binary “yes/no” answer is not enough, according to this epidemiologist from the Harvard University School of Public Health. “It’s the amount of virus that should dictate the course of action for each patient tested. » The amount of virus (viral load); but also and above all the clinical state, symptomatic or not of the person! This calls into question the use of the binary result of this RT-PCR test to determine whether a person is contagious and must follow strict isolation measures. These questions are being raised by many physicians around the world, not only in the United States but also in France, Belgium (Belgium Health Experts Demand Investigation Of WHO For Faking Coronavirus Pandemic), France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States and the United Kingdom. in Germany, Spain… According to them: “We are going to put tens of thousands of people in confinement, in isolation, for nothing. » [22]. 22] And inflict suffering, anguish, economic and psychological dramas by the thousands! Most RT-PCR tests set the Ct at 40, according to the NYT. Some set it at 37. “Tests with such high thresholds (Ct) may not only detect live virus but also gene fragments, remnants of an old infection that do not represent any particular danger,” the experts said. A virologist at the University of California admits that an RT-PCR test with a Ct greater than 35 is too sensitive. “A more reasonable threshold would be between 30 and 35,” she adds. Almost no laboratory specifies the Ct (number of amplification cycles performed) or the number of copies of viral RNA per sample μl. Here is an example of a laboratory result (approved by Sciensano, the Belgian national reference center) in an RT-PCR negative patient: No mention of Ct. In the NYT, experts compiled three datasets with officials from the states of Massachusetts, New York and Nevada that mention them. Conclusion? “Up to 90% of the people who tested positive did not carry a virus. » The Wadworth Center, a New York State laboratory, analyzed the results of its July tests at the request of the NYT: 794 positive tests with a Ct of 40. “With a Ct threshold of 35, approximately half of these PCR tests would no longer be considered positive,” said the NYT. “And about 70% would no longer be considered positive with a Ct of 30! “ In Massachusetts, between 85 and 90% of people who tested positive in July with a Ct of 40 would have been considered negative with a Ct of 30, adds the NYT. And yet, all these people had to isolate themselves, with all the dramatic psychological and economic consequences, while they were not sick and probably not contagious at all. In France, the Centre National de Référence (CNR), the French Society of Microbiology (SFM) continue to push Ct to 37 and recommend to laboratories to use only one gene of the virus as a primer. I remind you that from Ct 32 onwards, it becomes very difficult to culture the virus or to extract a complete sequence, which shows the completely artificial nature of this positivity of the test, with such high Ct levels, above 30. Similar results were reported by researchers from the UK Public Health Agency in an article published on August 13 in Eurosurveillance: “The probability of culturing the virus drops to 8% in samples with Ct levels above 35.” [23] In addition, currently, the National Reference Center in France only evaluates the sensitivity of commercially available reagent kits, not their specificity: serious doubts persist about the possibility of cross-reactivity with viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, such as other benign cold coronaviruses. [20] It is potentially the same situation in other countries, including Belgium. Similarly, mutations in the virus may have invalidated certain primers (genes) used to detect SARS-CoV-2: the manufacturers give no guarantees on this, and if the AFP fast-checking journalists tell you otherwise, test their good faith by asking for these guarantees, these proofs. If they have nothing to hide and if what I say is false, this guarantee will be provided to you and will prove their good faith. We must demand that the RT-PCR results be returned mentioning the Ct used because beyond Ct 30, a positive RT-PCR test means nothing. We must listen to the scientists and doctors, specialists, virologists who recommend the use of adapted Ct, lower, at 30. An alternative is to obtain the number of copies of viral RNA/μl or /ml sample. [23] We need to go back to the patient, to the person, to his or her clinical condition (presence or absence of symptoms) and from there to judge the appropriateness of testing and the best way to interpret the result. Until there is a better rationale for PCR screening, with a known and appropriate Ct threshold, an asymptomatic person should not be tested in any way. Even a symptomatic person should not automatically be tested, as long as they can place themselves in isolation for 7 days. Let’s stop this debauchery of RT-PCR testing at too high Ct levels and return to clinical, quality medicine. Once we understand how RT-PCR testing works, it becomes impossible to let the current government routine screening strategy, inexplicably supported by the virologists in the safety councils, continue. My hope is that, finally, properly informed, more and more people will demand that this strategy be stopped, because it is all of us, enlightened, guided by real benevolence and common sense, who must decide our collective and individual destinies. No one else should do it for us, especially when we realize that those who decide are no longer reasonable or rational. Summary of important points : The RT-PCR test is a laboratory diagnostic technique that is not well suited to clinical medicine. It is a binary, qualitative diagnostic technique that confirms (positive test) or not (negative test) the presence of an element in the medium being analyzed. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the element is a fragment of the viral genome, not the virus itself. In medicine, even in an epidemic or pandemic situation, it is dangerous to place tests, examinations, techniques above clinical evaluation (symptoms, signs). It is the opposite that guarantees quality medicine. The main limitation (weakness) of the RT-PCR test, in the current pandemic situation, is its extreme sensitivity (false positive) if a suitable threshold of positivity (Ct) is not chosen. Today, experts recommend using a maximum Ct threshold of 30. This Ct threshold must be informed with the positive RT-PCR result so that the physician knows how to interpret this positive result, especially in an asymptomatic person, in order to avoid unnecessary isolation, quarantine, psychological trauma. In addition to mentioning the Ct used, laboratories must continue to ensure the specificity of their detection kits for SARS-CoV-2, taking into account its most recent mutations, and must continue to use three genes from the viral genome being studied as primers or, if not, mention it. Overall Conclusion Is the obstinacy of governments to use the current disastrous strategy, systematic screening by RT-PCR, due to ignorance? Is it due to stupidity? To a kind of cognitive trap trapping their ego? In any case, we should be able to question them, and if among the readers of this article there are still honest journalists, or naive politicians, or people who have the possibility to question our rulers, then do so, using these clear and scientific arguments. It is all the more incomprehensible that our rulers have surrounded themselves with some of the most experienced specialists in these matters. If I have been able to gather this information myself, shared, I remind you, by competent people above all suspicion of conspiracy, such as Hélène Banoun, Pierre Sonigo, Jean-François Toussaint, Christophe De Brouwer, whose intelligence, intellectual honesty and legitimacy cannot be questioned, then the Belgian, French and Quebec scientific advisors, etc., know all this as well. So? What’s going on? Why continue in this distorted direction, obstinately making mistakes? It is not insignificant to reimpose confinements, curfews, quarantines, reduced social bubbles, to shake up again our shaky economies, to plunge entire families into precariousness, to sow so much fear and anxiety generating a real state of post-traumatic stress worldwide, to reduce access to care for other pathologies that nevertheless reduce life expectancy much more than COVID-19! [24] Is there intent to harm? Is there an intention to use the alibi of a pandemic to move humanity towards an outcome it would otherwise never have accepted? In any case, not like that! Would this hypothesis, which modern censors will hasten to label “conspiracy”, be the most valid explanation for all this? Indeed, if we draw a straight line from the present events, if they are maintained, we could find ourselves once again confined with hundreds, thousands of human beings forced to remain inactive, which, for the professions of catering, entertainment, sales, fairgrounds, itinerants, canvassers, risks being catastrophic with bankruptcies, unemployment, depression, suicides by the hundreds of thousands. [25-26-27-28] The impact on education, on our children, on teaching, on medicine with long planned care, operations, treatments to be cancelled, postponed, will be profound and destructive. “We risk a looming food crisis if action is not taken quickly.”  [29]. It is time for everyone to come out of this negative trance, this collective hysteria, because famine, poverty, massive unemployment will kill, mow down many more people than SARS-CoV-2! Does all this make sense in the face of a disease that is declining, over-diagnosed and misinterpreted by this misuse of overly sensitively calibrated PCR tests? For many, the continuous wearing of the mask seems to have become a new norm. Even if it is constantly downplayed by some health professionals and fact-checking journalists, other doctors warn of the harmful consequences, both medical and psychological, of this hygienic obsession which, maintained permanently, is in fact an abnormality! What a hindrance to social relations, which are the true foundation of a physically and psychologically healthy humanity! Some dare to find all this normal, or a lesser price to pay in the face of the pandemic of positive PCR tests. Isolation, distancing, masking of the face, impoverishment of emotional communication, fear of touching and kissing even within families, communities, between relatives… Spontaneous gestures of daily life hindered and replaced by mechanical and controlled gestures … Terrified children, kept in permanent fear and guilt… All this will have a deep, lasting and negative impact on human organisms, in their physical, mental, emotional and representation of the world and society. This is not normal! We cannot let our rulers, for whatever reason, organize our collective suicide any longer.
5G Corporate Grail. Microwave Radiation | Smart cities/dumb people? There’s a lot of hype about #5G, the fifth-generation wireless technology that is being rolled out in various “5G test beds” in major cities including Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, New York, and Los Angeles. But it’s hard to see why we should be excited. Proponents talk about the facilitation of driverless vehicles and car-to-car “talk,” better Virtual Reality equipment, and, of course, “The Internet of Things” (IoT) – the holy grail of Big Tech that is just vague enough to sound sort of promising. But when it comes to specifics, there seems to be a lot of hot air in the IoT bag. For example, in March 2018, Canada’s Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, while pumping $400 million into 5G test beds, reportedly “gushed” about IoT applications, including “refrigerators that monitor food levels and automatically order fresh groceries.” Then there is the 5G proponent who enthused to CBC News (March 19, 2018) about “augmented reality headsets” being replaced by “a pair of normal looking glasses,” which everyone would be wearing in 10 years. Those glasses would “automatically recognize everyone you meet, and possibly be able to overlay their name in your field of vision, along with a link to their online profile.” Apparently, the future human will be too brain-addled to make a grocery list or remember the names of acquaintances… which may not be the image that 5G proponents are hoping for. “There are thousands of published studies that show that even low levels of microwave radiation do cause a biological effect.” Amidst all the #5G hype, it’s rare to find a blunt statement like this one from Eluxe Magazine’s Jody McCutcheon: “Until now mobile broadband networks have been designed to meet the needs of people. But 5G has been created with machines’ needs in mind, offering low-latency, high-efficiency data transfer…. We humans won’t notice the difference [in data transfer speeds], but it will permit machines to achieve near-seamless communication. Which in itself may open a whole Pandora’s box of trouble for us – and our planet.” Box of trouble Many scientists would say that box of trouble has already been opened by earlier wireless technologies, which emit health-endangering electromagnetic radiation. As Josh del Sol Beaulieu, creator of the documentary Take Back Your Power, told me by email, “There are literally thousands of published studies that show that even low levels of microwave radiation do cause a biological effect.” In fact, in March of this year, the scientific peer review of a landmark US National Toxicology Program study on mobile phone radiation and health found that there is “clear evidence” that radiation from mobile phones causes cancer – specifically, a heart tissue cancer in rats, and “some evidence” of cancer in the brain and adrenal glands. “One key player has not been swayed by all this wireless-friendly research: the insurance industry…. ‘Why would we want to do that?’ one executive asked with a chuckle before pointing to more than two dozen lawsuits outstanding against wireless companies demanding a total of $1.9 billion in damages.” But as Mark Hertsgaard and Mark Dowie reported in The Guardian (July 14, 2018), “Not one major news organization in the US or Europe reported this scientific news.” They attribute that silence to the power of the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA) and the whole wireless industry, which for decades “has been orchestrating a global PR campaign aimed at misleading not only journalists, but also consumers and policymakers about the actual science concerning mobile phone radiation.” They have used the same “doubt-creation” strategy used by the tobacco industry and the oil industry: fund friendly research to make it seem like the scientific community is truly divided on issues like smoking or climate change. But, as Hertsgaard and Dowie note, “One key player has not been swayed by all this wireless-friendly research: the insurance industry.” In their reporting for the story, they found “not a single insurance company that would sell a product-liability policy that covered mobile phone radiation. ‘Why would we want to do that?’ one executive asked with a chuckle before pointing to more than two dozen lawsuits outstanding against wireless companies demanding a total of $1.9 billion in damages.” Massive experiment Recently, 236 radiation-research scientists from around the world have signed a petition charging that 5G will be “massively increasing” the general population’s radiation exposure. And it’s not just humans that are endangered by this. Dr. Joel Moskowitz, a University of California-Berkeley public health professor, told the UK’s Daily Mail (May 29, 2018) that the deployment of 5G “constitutes a massive experiment on the health of all species.” In order to facilitate faster data-transfer speeds, 5G will utilize millimeter waves (MMWs), smaller waves accessed through a higher frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum not previously used by the telecom industry. These smaller waves cannot travel far, nor can they penetrate many types of materials. So this means that there will need to be millions of “small cell towers” (about the size of a refrigerator) close together – within a few feet of one another on every street. Dr. Moskowitz warns that these millimeter waves can affect the eyes, the testes, the skin, the nervous system, and the sweat glands. Eluxe Magazine’s Jody McCutcheon states that the higher-frequency MMW bands “give off the same dose of radiation as airport scanners. The effects of this radiation on public health have yet to undergo the rigours of long-term testing.” Adding to the dangers to the planet, 5G infrastructure will depend on the deployment of thousands of satellites propelled into orbit by hydrocarbon rocket engines, contributing to atmospheric pollution. An Oct. 27, 2016 article in The Ecologist titled “Wireless pollution ‘out of control’ as corporate race for 5G gears up” states: “The long-term, ecological implications of our new, anthropogenic radiation are not known. But peer-reviewed studies revealing harm to birds, tadpoles, trees, other plants, insects, rodents and livestock, offer clues.” Given that he called 5G “a massive experiment on the health of all species,” I asked Dr. Moskowitz whether the mainstream media had expressed interest in this perspective. He replied by email, “Although I have been interviewed hundreds of times by journalists since 2009 about cell phone health effects, there has been little interest in 5G,” with only three publications in the past two years showing interest in the new technology’s health effects. When asked why there is such a rush to deploy 5G, Dr. Moskowitz responded that the telecom companies in the US “have convinced policymakers and the public that we are in a global race with China and other countries to deploy this new technology, and that we won’t reap the economic benefits unless we are the first to deploy.” As well, the industry claims that we need 5G for the Internet of Things and to “improve broadband internet access in rural areas,” although such claims are “arguable.” Josh del Sol Beaulieu told me that the rush into 5G is because of “corporate profit – ‘tens of billions of dollars of economic activity’ as stated very clearly by former FCC [US Federal Communications Commission] frontman Tom Wheeler in 2016.” Beaulieu refers to the fact that surveillance is becoming big business. “If the data harvested unlawfully from ‘smart’ meters will be worth much more than residential electricity, than what will the unparalleled amount of ‘user data’ harvested by ultra-invasive 5G technology be worth?” Beaulieu also mentions the fact that 5G “emits the same frequencies that are used in crowd control weapons” developed by the Pentagon. Gadgets & climate change People are becoming aware of the “dirty” side to their gadgets: the horrendous conditions of the coltan miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the mounting e-waste; the social and personal implications of our addictions to these devices. More recently, the connection to climate change has been revealed. As tech site Gizmodo has explained, “The Internet works because every network is connected, somehow, to every other. Where do those connections physically happen? More than anywhere else in America, the answer is ‘Ashburn’ [Virginia].” This location is one of many data-hubs in that state where, as U.S. News put it, “Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, hundreds of thousands of servers here rapidly transmit E-mails, process Internet search queries, safeguard classified data, handle online financial transactions, and store videos and medical records. And suck up megawatts.” Calling these massive data servers “energy hogs,” U.S. News noted that they’re located in Virginia because that state has “the country’s cheapest electricity rates.” Indeed, The Guardian reported (July 17, 2018) that “70% of the world’s online traffic” is routed through just one county in Virginia, with such server farms “set to soon have a bigger carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry.” The article  points out the IT industry is predicted to account for 14% of the world’s total carbon emissions by 2040, with the Internet of Things adding greatly to that number. But now the push is on in the US for these energy hogs to use “clean energy.” (Is that why the Trudeau Liberal government is planning to build 118 hydroelectric dams in the coming years?) Beaulieu suggests we educate our city councillors to resist the 5G build-out. Others recommend staying wired, and refusing to buy any “smart” appliances. With the Canadian government poised to auction off more of the electromagnetic spectrum to the telecom industry, we can also remember that the spectrum is part of the Commons. We should all have a say in this.
Does the US Military “Own the Weather”? “Weaponizing the Weather” as an Instrument of Modern Warfare? | First published in September 2017, this article is of relevance to the ongoing protest movement and debate on Climate Change (COP25)“Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog and storms on earth or to modify space weather… and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of [military] technologies.” (Study Commissioned by the US Air Force: Weather as a Force Multiplier, Owning the Weather in 2025, August 1996) **Environmental modification techniques have been available to the US military for more than half a century. The issue has been amply documented and should be part of the climate change debate. The U.N. Climate Conference (COP 25) met in Madrid with Delegates from nearly 200 countries. The focus was on Greenhouse gas emissions. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, “every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way.”:  A narrow consensus which focusses on the nefarious impacts of CO2 emissions (from fossil fuel) on World temperature. What has casually been omitted from the COP debate is the manipulation of climate for military use. The broader issue of environmental modification techniques (ENMOD) must be addressed and carefully analyzed. It should also be understood that the instruments of weather warfare are part of the US arsenal of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their proposed use by the US military against “enemies” constitutes not only a crime against humanity but to put it mildly a threat to planet earth. In this essay I am providing the reader with direct quotes from a publicly available 1996 US Air Force document on the use of environmental modification techniques which indelibly provide evidence that the threats are real and must be addressed. It should be noted that the US is in violation of  a historic 1977 international Convention ratified by the UN General Assembly which banned “military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects.” (AP, 18 May 1977). Both the US and the Soviet Union were signatories to the Convention. ….Each State Party to this Convention undertakes not to engage in military … use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage or injury to any other State Party. (Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, United Nations, Geneva, May 18, 1977. Entered into force: 5 October 1978, see full text of Convention in Annex) Michel Chossudovsky, September 15, 2018, revised December 4, 2019 *** US mathematician John von Neumann, in liaison with the US Department of Defense, started his research on weather modification in the late 1940s at the height of the Cold War and foresaw ‘forms of climatic warfare as yet unimagined’. During the Vietnam war, cloud-seeding techniques were used, starting in 1967 under Project Popeye, the objective of which was to prolong the monsoon season and block enemy supply routes along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The US military has developed advanced capabilities that enable it selectively to alter weather patterns. The technology, which was initially developed in the 1990s under the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP), was an appendage of the Strategic Defense Initiative – ‘Star Wars’. From a military standpoint, HAARP  –which was officially abolished in 2014– is  a weapon of mass destruction, operating from the outer atmosphere and capable of destabilising agricultural and ecological systems around the world. Officially, the HAARP program has been closed down at its location in Alaska. The technology of weather modification shrouded in secrecy, nonetheless prevails. HAARP documents confirm that the technology was fully operational as of the mid 1990s. (For further details see Michel Chossudovsky, The Ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction: Owning the Weather for Military Use, first published by Global Research in 2006).  It should be emphasized that while the US military confirms that weather warfare is fully operational, there is no documented evidence of its military use against enemies of the US. The subject matter is a taboo among environmental analysts. No in-depth investigation has been undertaken to reveal the operational dimensions of weather warfare. The irony is that the impacts of ENMOD techniques for military use were documented by CBC TV in the early 1990s. The CBC TV report acknowledged that the HAARP facility in Alaska under the auspices of the US Air Force had the ability of triggering typhoons, earthquakes, floods and droughts: . Directed energy is such a powerful technology it could be used to heat the ionosphere to turn weather into a weapon of war. Imagine using a flood to destroy a city or tornadoes to decimate an approaching army in the desert. The military has spent a huge amount of time on weather modification as a concept for battle environments. If an electromagnetic pulse went off over a city, basically all the electronic things in your home would wink and go out, and they would be permanently destroyed.” In this article we will provide key quotations from a US 1996 US Air Force document which analyzes weather modification techniques for military use. The underlying objective from a military standpoint is “Owning the Weather”. At the time this study was commissioned in  1996, the HAARP program was already fully operational as documented by the CBC documentary. The stated purpose of the Report is described below: In this paper we show that appropriate application of weather-modification can provide battlespace dominance to a degree never before imagined. In the future, such operations will enhance air and space superiority and provide new options for battlespace shaping and battlespace awareness there, waiting for us to pull it all together;” in 2025 we can “Own the Weather.” (Commissioned by US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report,  (public document) Weather-modification, according to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report,  “offers the war fighter a wide range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary”, capabilities, it says, extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes: ‘Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog and storms on earth or to modify space weather… and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of [military] technologies.”   ….From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of global communications and counterspace control, weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary. Some of the potential capabilities a weather-modification system could provide to a war-fighting commander in chief (CINC) are listed in table 1. Why Would We Want to Mess with the Weather? is the subtitle of chapter 2 of the Report “According to Gen Gordon Sullivan, former Army chief of staff, “As we leap technology into the 21st century, we will be able to see the enemy day or night, in any weather— and go after him relentlessly.” global, precise, real-time, robust, systematic weather-modification capability would provide war-fighting CINCs with a powerful force multiplier to achieve military objectives. Since weather will be common to all possible futures, a weather-modification capability would be universally applicable and have utility across the entire spectrum of conflict. The capability of influencing the weather even on a small scale could change it from a force degrader to a force multiplier.” Under the heading: What Do We Mean by “Weather-modification”? The report states: “The term weather-modification may have negative connotations for many people, civilians and military members alike. It is thus important to define the scope to be considered in this paper so that potential critics or proponents of further research have a common basis for discussion. In the broadest sense, weather-modification can be divided into two major categories: suppression and intensification of weather patterns. In extreme cases, it might involve the creation of completely new weather patterns, attenuation or control of severe storms, or even alteration of global climate on a far-reaching and/or long-lasting scale. In the mildest and least controversial cases it may consist of inducing or suppressing precipitation, clouds, or fog for short times over a small-scale region. Other low-intensity applications might include the alteration and/or use of near space as a medium to enhance communications, disrupt active or passive sensing, or other purposes.” (emphasis added) The Triggering of Storms: “Weather-modification technologies might involve techniques that would increase latent heat release in the atmosphere, provide additional water vapor for cloud cell development, and provide additional surface and lower atmospheric heating to increase atmospheric instability. Critical to the success of any attempt to trigger a storm cell is the pre-existing atmospheric conditions locally and regionally. The atmosphere must already be conditionally unstable and the large-scale dynamics must be supportive of vertical cloud development. The focus of the weather-modification effort would be to provide additional “conditions” that would make the atmosphere unstable enough to generate cloud and eventually storm cell development. The path of storm cells once developed or enhanced is dependent not only on the mesoscale dynamics of the storm but the regional and synoptic (global) scale atmospheric wind flow patterns in the area which are currently not subject to human control.” (page 19) Is the CIA involved in Climate Engineering?  The Involvement of the CIA in Climate Change Technologies Back in July 2013,  MSN news reported that the CIA was involved in helping to fund a project by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) focusing on geo-engineering and climate manipulation. The report not only acknowledged these technologies, it confirmed that US intelligence has been routinely involved in addressing the issue of climatic manipulation: “The CIA is helping fund the research because the NAS also plans to evaluate “the national security concerns (that could be) related to geoengineering technologies being deployed somewhere in the world,” Kearney said. In an emailed statement, Christopher White, a spokesman for the CIA’s office of public affairs, told MSN, “On a subject like climate change, the agency works with scientists to better understand the phenomenon and its implications on national security.” Although the CIA and the NAS are tight-lipped about what these concerns might be, one researcher notes that geoengineering has the potential to deliberately disrupt the weather for terrorist or military goals. John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based firm that specializes in addressing emerging security concerns, says that worries about the potential impact of geoengineering aren’t as paramount as the potential security issues that could arise if the United States doesn’t use the technology. “A failure to engage in geoengineering could impact the political stability of other countries, and that could lead to trouble for the U.S.,” he said. The NAS project is supported by the U.S. intelligence community, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Department of Energy. “historical examples of related technologies (e.g., cloud seeding and other weather modification) for lessons that might be learned about societal reactions, examine what international agreements exist which may be relevant to the experimental testing or deployment of geoengineering technologies, and briefly explore potential societal and ethical considerations related to geoengineering. This study is intended to provide a careful, clear scientific foundation that informs ethical, legal, and political discussions surrounding geoengineering.” According to a  2015 report in the Independent (screenshot above), quoting a renowned US scientist Alan Robock: “A senior American climate scientist has spoken of the fear he experienced when US intelligence services apparently asked him about the possibility of weaponising the weather as a major report on geo-engineering is to be published this week. Professor Alan Robock stated that three years ago, two men claiming to be from the CIA had called him to ask whether experts would be able to tell if hostile forces had begun manipulating the US’s weather, though he suspected the purpose of the call was to find out if American forces could meddle with other countries’ climates instead.”
Gene Editing and “Genetically Modified Humans”: China’s “Golem Babies”. There Is Another Agenda | “Just a few engineered organisms could irrevocably alter an ecosystem.” The shocking news that a team of scientists working in China have managed to gene-edit the DNA of recently-born human twins to allegedly make them genetically immune to a HIV infection is more than bizarre and irresponsible. It suggests that certain researchers are making dangerous experiments to create ultimately the eugenics master dream—custom-designed humans. I call them Golem babies because when technology begins cutting and splicing the human DNA without certitude that the result will be stable or healthy to the human species it is not healthy. In medieval and ancient Jewish folklore a Golem is a being that is magically created entirely from inanimate matter such as mud. Golems have no soul. Similarly, the China experiment that claims the “first successful genetically modified humans,” when we go behind the surface stories, is alarming in the extreme. HIV Immune? First of all the public story retailed by Chinese media and by the researcher, Chinese Professor He Jiankui, a Stanford University post-doctoral research graduate, doesn’t ring honest. He, who is professor at Southern University of Science and Technology, claimed at a Human Genome Editing conference in Hong Kong on November 28, and on YouTube, that he had successfully modified two embryos produced from the sperm of an HIV-positive donor and implanted them in a healthy mother, who gave birth to twin girls earlier this month. He used the most common “gene-editing” tool, CRISPR-cas9, to deactivate a gene called CCR5 that acts as a ‘doorway’ to allow the HIV virus to enter a cell. He basically claimed to have created the world’s first gene-edited humans, and announced that a second woman was pregnant with another of his gene-edited embryos. Other scientists have severely criticized He for engaging in the human gene altering experiments. What He claims he did, to alter the DNA of human embryos, known as germ line gene editing, means the changes in those genes could be passed on and inherited by the next generations. Moreover, as several scientists involved in developing CRISPR have warned, He is in fact changing the human gene pool. “We may not be able to see the impact of this until several generations later,” said Dennis Lo Yuk-ming, chairman of Chinese University’s Department of Chemical Pathology. The scientist who first suggested developing gene drives in gene editing, Harvard biologist Kevin Esvelt, has publicly warned that development of gene editing, in conjunction with gene drive technologies, have alarming potential to go awry. He notes how often CRISPR messes up and the likelihood of mutations arising, making even benign gene drives aggressive. He stresses, “Just a few engineered organisms could irrevocably alter an ecosystem.” Esvelt’s computer gene drive simulations calculated that a resulting edited gene, “can spread to 99 percent of a population in as few as 10 generations, and persist for more than 200 generations.” Esvelt was discussing gene editing of mosquitoes. Now we are moving on to gene editing of human embryos. Adding to the drama, at the Hong Kong gene editing conference where He proudly announced his results for the first time, Professor He refused to answer questions as to who paid for his work, or why he kept his work secret until after it was done. Chinese officials claim they had no knowledge of He’s project. There has been no independent confirmation of He’s claim, nor has he yet published in any scientific peer-reviewed journal on it. Adding to the questions around the case, Dr Michael Deem, a bio-engineering professor at the esteemed Texas Rice University, has been revealed to have worked on the gene-editing project using humans together with He. He Jiankui got his PhD at Rice in 2010 and that year began co-authoring scientific papers with Deem. Deem also reportedly has a financial interest in two gene-editing companies that the enterprising He has set up in China. Dr. Deem, who also receives research money from the US government National Institutes of Health, did not inform Rice University of his involvement in what under current US law is illegal. Eugenics and Unanswered Questions He has in the meantime been ordered to stop his human experiments with gene-editing, pending a government investigation. He declared that Chinese law, which is apparently vague on the issue, does not prohibit gene-editing with human subjects. What is clear is that, as in many areas, China sees itself in a technology race with the West. As part of the 10 development priorities of its ambitious Made in China 2025 strategy, the government lists “Biotechnology” as a priority area. Unfortunately, the government does not exclude proven harmful biotech areas such as Genetically Manipulated Organisms or GMOs. In 2017 the state-owned ChemChina took over the Swiss-based Syngenta, the world’s largest agri-chemical producer, and third largest in GMO seed patents. In the area of toxic plant herbicide, glyphosate, designated by an WHO agency a “probable carcinogen,” Chinese companies make up far the world’s largest producers. In 2017, the global glyphosate production capacity was 1,065,000 tons. Of that was 380,000 tons by Monsanto and 685,000 tons of Chinese enterprises. Now it appears that China is moving to become world leader in gene-editing. In January the US National Science Foundation released its annual report, Science and Engineering Indicators: 2018 report. It noted that while the USA till led in science and technology development, that “the US global share of S&T activities is declining as other nations — especially China — continue to rise.” Gene editing and Artificial Intelligence were two areas of rapid Chinese development they cited. What is not yet clear is whether certain US Government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health which funds Deem at Rice is quietly funding the He human gene-editing projects, taking advantage of the lax regulatory regime there. Or whether the spooky Pentagon research arm, DARPA, is involved. As I noted in a previous article, DARPA’s “Insect Allies” program “aims to disperse infectious genetically modified viruses that have been engineered to edit crop chromosomes directly in fields.” This is known as “horizontal inheritance” as opposed to the dominant vertical method of GMO alteration that make laboratory-generated modifications into target species’ chromosomes to create GMO plant varieties. The genetic alterations to the crops would be carried out by “insect-based dispersion” in free nature. A group of European scientists strongly criticized the DARPA gene-editing Insect Allies project. They noted that no compelling reasons have been presented by DARPA for the use of insects as an uncontrolled means of dispersing synthetic viruses into the environment. Furthermore, they argue that the Insect Allies Program could be more easily used for biological warfare than for routine agricultural use. “It is very much easier to kill or sterilize a plant using gene editing than it is to make it herbicide or insect-resistant,” according to Guy Reeves. At this point it seems that the Chinese government is taking steps to rein in the rogue professor He and his research. What is not clear however, is whether this is cosmetic in an attempt to diffuse enormous criticism of the He human gene-editing. Earlier this year the Wall Street Journal reported that according to review of Chinese scientific journal articles, since 2015 at least 86 people have been subject of gene-editing experiments. They reported that in 2015 it began when 36 patients with kidney, lung, liver and throat cancers had cells removed that allowed were then gene-edited ad replanted in the human bodies to supposedly combat their cancer. The newspaper noted that none of the clinical trials have been formally published. The entire field of gene-editing as with the Genome Project and GMO patented seeds, is a decades-long dream of some very influential actors such as the Rockefeller family and Bill Gates in what is called eugenics. The effort is based on fatally-flawed scientific reductionism that claims that the complexity of life can be reduced to a single gene that in turn can be modified at will. In a recent post on the flaws of gene-editing, namely the assertion that thousands of diseases are caused by malfunction of one gene, a hypothesis yet to be proven, researcher Jon Rappoport, who sees gene-editing as “part and parcel of the trans-human agenda,” quotes Gregory Stock, former director of the program in Medicine, Technology, and Society at the UCLA School of Medicine: Even if half the world’s species were lost [during genetic experiments], enormous diversity would still remain. When those in the distant future look back on this period of history, they will likely see it not as the era when the natural environment was impoverished, but as the age when a plethora of new forms—some biological, some technological, some a combination of the two—burst onto the scene. Scientists, including some of the original inventors of gene-editing technologies, who call for a world moratorium on gene drives and gene-editing until the science can be conclusively proven safe, perhaps gain the ear of the world after the shocking Chinese human gene-editing reports. Something that Bill Gates and DARPA back can’t be “all good.” In the classic Golem fable, much like Dr. Frankenstein’s monster, the rabbi had to resort to trickery to deactivate it, whereupon it crumbled upon its creator and crushed him. Gene-editing of humans has eerie echoes of that Golem myth.
Big Pharma: How They Manipulate American Medical Doctors |  “The pharmaceutical companies are an amoral bunch. They’re not a benevolent association.  So they are highly unlikely to donate large amounts of money without strings attached. Once one is dancing with the devil, you don’t always get to call the steps of the dance.”—A psychiatrist, quoted in the Boston Globe, 2002. The New England Journal of Medicine, under the editorship of Marcia Angell, MD, published a study in the May 18, 2000 issue whose principle author was the chief of Brown University’s Department of Psychiatry. The academic psychiatrist had reportedly made $500,000 in one year doing consultancy “work” for various psycho-pharmaceutical companies that marketed antidepressant drugs. In editing the article, Dr Angell discovered that there wasn’t enough room to print all the various co-author’s conflict of interest disclosures. Because of space limitations, Angell put the full list on the website rather than in the hard copy issue. In a footnote to the article, she wrote: Our policy requires authors of Original Articles to disclose all financial ties with companies that make the products under study… In this case, the large number of authors and their varied and extensive financial associations with relevant companies make a detailed listing here impractical. Readers should know, however, that all but one of the twelve principal authors have had financial associations with Bristol-Myers Squibb – which also sponsored the study – and, in most cases, with many other companies producing psychoactive pharmaceutical agents. The associations include consultancies, receipt of research grants and honorariums, and participation on advisory boards. Angell then proceeded to write an editorial in the same issue. It was titled, “Is Academic Medicine for Sale?” In it she expressed her concern about the merging of commercial and academic interests.  “Q: Is academic medicine for sale? A: No. The current owner is very happy with it.” In response to Angell’s editorial, a reader sent a letter to the editor asking rhetorically, “Is academic medicine for sale? No. The current owner is very happy with it.” After two decades of exemplary work at the once prestigious NEJM, Dr Angell was shamefully and arbitrarily fired for stating the obvious. The courageous whistle-blower then proceeded to write her first book, The Truth About the Drug Companies: How They Deceive us and What to do About It (2004). Having heard about the sinister machinations of the hundreds of multinational pharmaceutical companies (that make the chemical pharmaceuticals that cause almost as many deaths in America as heart disease or cancer), I decided to put together sort of a timeline of the process of psychiatric drug development. There are many authors that back up what is printed below, including books, articles and lectures by Angell, Dr Peter Breggin (see www.breggin.com), Robert Whitaker (see www.madinamerica.org), Dr David Healy (http://davidhealy.org/articles/) and Dr Peter Gotzsche http://www.cochrane.dk/about/profiles/pcg-profile.htm), among others. Here is my approximation of how a new, potentially lethal brain-altering psych drug gets developed and then marketed by Big Pharma: How the Drug Industry’s Amoral Psychopharmacology Units Create the Next Hoped-for Blockbuster Drug Assign to your organic chemists (who decided to go to work for Big Pharma rather than teach and do research at lower pay at some university) the job of exploiting an innovative, un-patented small molecule that is likely to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid. (Knowing that most such molecules have been discovered and partially developed by tax-supported public institutions, like university research/teaching hospitals, you will still later imply that your research and development unit did all the work and incurred all the expense.) Test the new chemical on hundreds or thousands of laboratory animals (mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys) until you find the lowest dose that kills 100% of the animals. (That will be the LD 100 [lethal dose 100]). Then experiment with the dose until you find the one that kills 50% of the animals (that is the LD 50). Do forensic evaluations on the killed and surviving animals, focusing on the organs that might be of interest later in the marketing of the drug to humans. Find the dose that doesn’t kill any animals and observe the effects of the drug in a number of experiments, comparing those results with those animals that were given a placebo. In order to save time and money, have these experiments done in the shortest possible time period. (Ex: one day, 5 days or 21 days [which is considered a “long-term” animal lab trial].) Have the lab animal observations looked at by upper management, seeking their recommendations as to what the observed effects might point to the potential usefulness in treating an as yet to be determined (or invented) human disorder (perhaps for some future new psychiatric diagnosis or possibly a substitute for one of your drugs that will soon be losing its patent protection. (For example, slowed behaviors in the treated animal might indicate the new drug might be useful for anxiety, insomnia, seizures or hypertension, whereas agitated or manic drug-related behaviors might indicate that the nw drug might be useful for somnolence, fatigue, depression or so-called ADHD.) Establish a safe dose for humans. Then make a deal with one of the hundreds of reliable (ie, in getting positive results), “independent”, for-profit contract research organizations (CROs) that are in the business of doing human trials at less cost that your corporation. Insist on complete control of the design of the clinical trial, who will author it and the publication of the results. Pay millions of dollars to dozens of groups of psychiatrists who have lots of drugged-up and therefore compliant patients who might be willing – depending on the cash incentives – to sign a release of liability form and go off their old drugs in order to start taking the new experimental one. As an extra incentive consider paying a bonus payment to the doctor if he can get more than 5 patients to sign up.  Have the CRO ignore the fact that most of the psychiatric patients will have had dozens of previous psychiatric labels, a host of unknown psych drug-induced psycho-toxicities, neuro-toxicities, psych drug addictions or withdrawal syndromes in the past or present. Be assured that it will go without saying that the CRO will throw certain patients out of the clinical study during the pre-study “wash-out” phase of the experiment. Experience has shown that previously drugged-up patients who suddenly quit their old dependency-inducing drugs will commonly have immediate, unwanted withdrawal effects (such as death) which would adversely affect the study results. (If not “washed out” before the study officially begins, those patients would mess up the anticipated favorable – and orchestrated – publishable results). Be assured also that the patients who seem to tolerate stopping the old drugs (perhaps because they were being poisoned by them?) will further favorably skew the results to convince future prescribers of the benefits of the new blockbuster.  (“I feel so much better on this new pill, doc.”) If obtaining patients from the developed world is too difficult, have an offshore multinational research company that has a presence in some impoverished third world country do the human trials, even if the results from those malnourished, chronically ill, desperate (and therefore cheaper) patients will have little or no relevance to better-nourished American patients. (Many third world countries have corrupt, easily bribed governments that will allow unethical and potentially dangerous experimentation on its unaware, desperate or easily bribed citizens.) When the human trials are complete (in the case of antidepressants, lasting only an average of 4 – 6 weeks in length, despite the fact that most patients will be taking the drug for years), bury the unfavorable trial results, and refuse to show them to anybody, unless and until a court subpoenas them for the inevitable lawsuits for corporate malfeasance or physician, clinic or hospital malpractice. Massage the numbers of the two best-looking trials so the results that go to the FDA can be claimed to be “statistically significant” (even if the results are not “clinically significant”) even though the trial was only designed to be found “better” than a placebo. (American drug trials are only done in comparison with placebos and never a rival drug!) Present the two (of many) clinical trials to one of the FDA screening committees that have been found to be made up of mainly of psychiatrists with major financial or professional conflicts of interest (usually financial entanglements with Big Pharma or professional loyalty entanglements with the American Psychiatric Association [APA]). Don’t show them the failed trials (Ex: several failed SSRI drug trials – hidden from scrutiny by Big Pharma – clearly showed how dangerous they were for children. If those trials had been published, many pediatricians would not have prescribed them to their otherwise doomed innocent patients. If you perceive that there is a good chance that the FDA will approve your new drug for a specific disorder (invented or otherwise), have your marketing department develop television “public interest” commercials  about the existence (and seriousness!) of the  disorder for which the drug is to be marketed. Simultaneously, have your Washington, DC lobbyists alert the (APA) academic psychiatrists who are the “thought leaders” (and who are somewhere on your payroll) to invent a new Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel-approved psych label that will then be promoted by that small, obscure insider committee of corporate-connected psychiatrists who vote on such things. (Ed note: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel (DSM) is the billing manual for psychiatrists, whose patient-contact code numbers must be used or else no insurance payment will be forthcoming. Incidentally, the DSM has no statistics in it!) Create cunning TV commercials that show unhappy, tired confused actors posing as patients being transformed into happy and confident humans after they take your new drug. Have the disclaimers about the serious, sometimes lethal, drug effects appear in small print or recited by a speed reader. Issue cunning video commercials disguised as a news release about the new disorder or drug to mainstream television outlets, knowing that such free videos will be welcomed by lazy TV news desks as fillers or “news releases”, thus getting cheap advertising. Bribe physicians with junkets, vacations, clinic meals, trinkets, cheap continuing education courses, extravagant meals and “consulting fees” that will reliably influence them to prescribe your drug to as many patients as possible. Have your lobbyists (more Big Pharma lobbyists are in DC than there are legislators in Congress.) bribe, with campaign “contributions” and many of the inducements in # 18 above) as many politicians as it will take to block regulatory legislation, inducements for alternatives to Big Medicine and the sobering truths about corporations such as yours. Sit back and rake in the dough while America goes broke paying for all those toxic, addictive drugs and your toxic vaccines; and when  the lawsuits roll in (at least those that your raft of shyster lawyers couldn’t derail) from the families of dead or damaged patients, humbly accept the wrist slap admonition to “don’t to that again” and use a small portion of your windfall profits to settle out of court, admitting no guilt, and demanding that the judge apply a gag order to the plaintiffs so that nobody will ever find out how much was the settlement was for or other details of the lawsuit – typical tactics for psychopaths. And then go ahead and do it again. Utilizing the propaganda methods listed above, your psycho-pharmaceutical monopoly should still be around well every aquifer and every drinking water supply will be so contaminated with your metabolically-stable, toxic and unfilterable drugs (that can’t be adequately metabolized by the liver but are excreted in the urine) that every non-patient – and not just the drugged-up patients – will be struggling to survive on this poisoned planet. And you Big Pharma CEOs will soon be in the same boat as the rest of us because NASA apparently isn’t finding enough uncontaminated water (or oxygen) on Earth’s closest planet, as you had hoped. Perhaps you should say your Mea Culpas, tell the truth about your toxic products for a change, sell off your Big Pharma shares, stop the poisoning and join the human race.
Big Pharma as Organized Crime? | Interview with Dr Peter Gøtzsche Peter C Gøtzsche, MD exposes the pharmaceutical industries and their charade of fraudulent behavior, both in research and marketing where the morally repugnant disregard for human lives is the norm. “The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don t sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so different from anything else in life… Virtually everything we know about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our doctors… the reason patients trust their medicine is that they extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they prescribe. The patients don’t realize that, although their doctors may know a lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very little about drugs that hasn’t been carefully concocted and dressed up by the drug industry… If you don t think the system is out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of death… If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new bacterium or a virus,or even one-hundredth of it, we would have done everything we could to get it under control.” Peter C. Gøtzsche, MD is a Danish medical researcher, and leader of the Nordic Cochrane Center at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark. He has written numerous reviews within the Cochrane collaboration.
Planting Trees Can Reduce Poverty and Slow Climate Change | Humanitarian crises have recently been declared in Sudan, Yemen, Niger, Mali, and Somalia—affecting at least 450,000 people—due to flash floods and landslides. Areas with low tree coverage and poor soil quality are more likely to experience flood and drought, as the soil is less able to retain excess rainwater. Countries like Morocco, which are highly susceptible to long periods of drought, are welcoming reforestation efforts to improve agriculture. In partnership with civil society, the Moroccan government will plant 800,000 trees across the country by 2024. Like Morocco, many are turning to agroforestry, or tree-farming, as an eco-friendly solution to climate issues. Globally, at least 650 million hectares of land (13.3% of total farming land) are used for agroforestry systems. Planting trees also diversifies farming. Estimates claim forest-farms can be eight times more profitable than staple crops like grain, which can increase farmers’ incomes and reduce rural poverty. Deforestation and poverty are linked Almost 30 percent of the world’s 821 million malnourished people live in Africa, the highest prevalence by region. Despite socioeconomic improvements in Morocco (1.7 million Moroccans have moved out of poverty in the last decade), droughts continue to threaten agricultural production, which accounts for 20 percent of GDP and 30 percent of the Moroccan workforce. Low crop yield can exacerbate poverty, especially in rural regions, as two thirds of people who are in extreme poverty work as agricultural laborers. However, African farmers are beginning to diversify their incomes, a method Morocco has been successful with in improving rural economies and reducing poverty throughout the region. For Moroccan farmers, this has meant investing in cash crops, such as fruit and argan trees, as opposed to producing principal crops, such as wheat and barley. An oasis in the desert Forest-gardens, or “food forests,” have been around since ancient times. These cultivated forests contain several layers. The top layer, usually fruit or nut trees, provides shade and traps moisture for smaller edible plants, such as shrubs and root crops. One of the most well-known forest-gardens in Morocco, located in Agadir, is the Inraren forest, a strip of tropical fruit trees that covers approximately 65 acres. While the exact origins of the forest are untraceable, many believe that it has existed for at least 2,000 years. The area began as a small gathering of plants, an alternative to transporting and cultivating food sources far away from home. Locals tended the area over thousands of years, creating a support system—beneficial insects, cultivation techniques, and traditional horticultural knowledge. The end-result was the creation of a “self-sustaining” ecosystem, a so-called oasis in the desert, where local produce—goats, chickens, pheasants—could live within and contribute to the survival of the trees and crops. In addition to food staples and non-native produce, these forests provide shady spaces where cool, moist air can gather, keeping the surrounding land firm and water-retentive. The goal of food-forest developers is to create these forests in areas where the soil is prone to becoming loose and dry. Resilience by planting trees In order to combat the effects of global warming, governments are embracing reforestation initiatives. A simple initiative may involve tree planting as an activity. The Chinese government, for example, enacted a program in 1982 to combat the effects of climate change within the country, establishing that all able-bodied citizens between the ages of 11 and 60 have the obligation to plant three to five trees every year. Local governments are required to organize voluntary tree-planting activities that engage all citizens. This ensures that trees are not planted in unwanted areas that could harm the land or the people. Since the program began, a total of 42 billion trees have been planted across the country. The High Atlas Foundation (HAF), a development nonprofit based in Marrakech, offers a method of reducing rural poverty by providing farmers with natural-grown fruit and nut trees to diversify and boost local incomes. The approach connects three levels of stakeholders—individuals within the community, government, and local organizations—and provides a solution to barriers local farmers may face in trying to grow their own trees. Local farmers may not have available land or proper equipment to grow saplings from seeds, and nearby nurseries may be too expensive to purchase from. HAF nurseries use land donated in-kind from donors such as the local Departments of Water and Forests, Ministry of Youth and Sports, and the Moroccan Jewish community. Locals grow seeds within these nurseries, keeping the process within the community. Then tree saplings are sold at reduced prices to local farmers, planted, and monitored for proper growth. In this way, the organization has planted 1.38 million tree seeds this year, partnering as well with Ecosia. Similar support within the country has helped build women’s argan oil cooperatives, by providing argan trees, thereby reducing inequalities and bringing money back into local economies. As climate change continues to affect communities around the world, reforestation and tree farming methods provide a solution. However, economic and political aspects of land ownership can challenge these initiatives. It will be important for those who choose to plant trees to do so in the right places.
Europe’s Lack of Confidence Hampers Signing of Trade Agreement with China | After seven years of tough negotiations, the European Union and China were close to signing an investment agreement. However, at the last moment, it hit a road block as it faced pressure from those wanting Washington’s involvement, or those wanting to impose Western Liberalism on China. A strategic analysis document by the European Union in November 2019 claimed that China is “a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.” Josep Borrell, the head of the European Union’s diplomacy, called on Brussels to adopt in May 2020 a “more robust strategy” vis-à-vis Beijing. The investment agreement that was hoped to be reached between Brussels and Beijing seems to reflect this European ambition. Launched in November 2013, negotiations accelerated in mid-December and was leading to the imminent conclusion of a compromise to mutually protect European investments in China and Chinese investment in the European Union. During a press briefing on December 18, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said “negotiations are in the final stage.”Significant progress was made during the ten negotiation sessions organized in 2020, and the European Commission seemed confident that an agreement could be reached. “We are not quite there yet but it is definitely feasible that, if things move forward as they are moving now, that we can conclude still this year,” Valdis Dombrovskis, the vice-president of the European Commission in charge of the Economy, said to Bloomberg last week. It is likely that if Beijing makes real concessions by opening its market to Europeans in the biotechnology, electric automotive and the medical sectors, Brussels would allow the presence of Chinese companies in the renewable energy market. The European Union’s objective is to ensure reciprocity as certain economic sectors must not become completely dependent on China. While it was essential to speed up the timetable for talks in order to crown the end of the German presidency of the European Union, whose six-month mandate has only been marred by failure to protect European interests and servitude to Washington’s demands, it evokes just a purely symbolic text. The terms of the agreement remain vague as ratification by the European Parliament is unlikely because many European Members of Parliament continue a hostile policy against China due to its alleged human rights violations. Some speculate that an agreement was never supposed to be reached but is rather an exercise to maintain dialogue between the two economic powerhouses. For the Chinese, their desire is to quickly conclude these negotiations, particularly during the American presidential transition period. However, despite this Chinese desire, certain European countries are resisting efforts to make an agreement with Beijing before the self-imposed deadline on December 31. Unsurprisingly, Poland was the first European Union member to openly resist the “premature” investment deal with China.“Europe should seek a fair, mutually beneficial Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with China. We need more consultations and transparency bringing our transatlantic allies on board. A good, balanced deal is better than a premature one,” Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau tweeted on Tuesday. He effectively called for a European-Chinese deal to have Washington’s blessing and involvement by highlighting the necessity to have “transatlantic allies on board. Biden’s incoming national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, expressed his satisfaction that Poland wants to involve Washington in a European-Chinese trade deal, stating in a tweet that “The Biden-Harris administration would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices.” The scepticism was not only reduced to Poland as France also joined the fray, albeit for different reasons. Franck Riester, France’s junior minister for trade, said to Le Monde: “We can’t facilitate investment in China if we don’t work to abolish forced labor.” He also admitted that trade deals should be used as a tool to “advance social issues” in China. In fact, it is this demand that trade deals be connected to domestic issues of a country that has resulted in France losing influence in Africa, while China, which makes no such demands in trade agreements, continues to advance on the continent as it does not interfere in the internal running’s of a country. The French and Polish scepticism also has the support of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and many Members of the European Parliament, such as Germany’s Reinhard Bütikofer who challenged the trade deal by questioning whether Europe should “really help [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] show Joe Biden the middle finger?” What this demonstrates is that the European Union is stuck with a 20th century outlook for the 21st century.  Whereas Western Liberalism was protected and projected by Washington during the Cold War and the unipolar-era after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, European leaders and lawmakers are unwilling to relinquish this antiquated thinking. Poland’s insistence that Washington be involved in negotiations between Europe and China demonstrates that many countries in the Old Continent lack the confidence to engage in the multipolar system as part of an independent European bloc. Although the French are attempting to make the European bloc independent, it faces tough resistance by those wanting Washington’s approval. However, France also limits itself by imposing Western Liberalism as a condition for trade negotiations, not only with China, but with most post-colonial countries. It is unlikely that China and the European Union will reach an agreement by the self-imposed deadline of December 31. This is due to Europe’s own lack of confidence as a Great Power, insistence that they do not act independently by continuously wanting U.S. input, and the insistence of imposing Western Liberalism on a Far East country. If European strategic thinking could change, an agreement could rapidly be made, however, it is highly unlikely to occur by the end of the year. *
US Pork-Laden Stimulus Bill | From 1975 – 1988, Senator William Proxmire (1915 – 2005) waged war on wasteful government spending — aka pork. Along with other vital issues he championed, he was well-known for scores of Golden Fleece Awards (GFA) that exposed wasteful congressional pork included in federal legislation. He wrote books on government waste and corruption. Among many other recipients, GFAs went to US departments of war, treasury, labor, agriculture, commerce, interior, HHS and DOJ, the White House, Congress, NASA, the FAA, VA, US Postal Service, and EPA. The so-called Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (that includes economic stimulus — HR 133) is heavily laden with pork. If Proxmire was active in the Senate today, it would likely be top-featured for a GFA. Over 5,500 pages in length, it’s likely certain that virtually all House all Senate members at most only glanced through it. Nearly all congressional legislation includes wasteful and/or unrelated pork. HR 133 overflows with what’s unrelated to stimulus aid for millions of US households that are enduring the Greatest Depression that’s likely to be protracted. Crumbs are included for them, including: A one-time payment of $600 for qualified adults, another $600 per child under age-16. It’s for individuals with annual income of $75,000 or less — $150,000 or less for couples — the amount decreasing for higher-income households. An additional $300 in weekly unemployment benefits runs through March — a woefully inadequate amount for hard-pressed households. $284 billion goes for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Most of what’s allegedly for troubled small businesses most likely will go to large ones. According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), HR 133 “is a fraction of what is required to address” dire economic conditions for most US households. Missing is aid for state and local governments. EPI explained that without it, they’re forced to cut essential services at the cost of millions of lost public and private sector jobs. Unemployment insurance (UI) in the measure is “woefully underpowered,” said EPI. Most US households receiving UI benefits will exhaust them in mid-March. EPI said it’s “imperative (for) the incoming Congress pass another substantial stimulus package early in the new year to ensure working people and states and localities receive the economic relief needed…” It called for vitally needed $3 trillion in stimulus — pork-free. Pork in HR 133 includes billions of dollars for weapons procurement, billions more for a space force. According to former Treasury tax official Adam Looney: HR 133’s Payroll Protection Program not only gives corporate America tax-free federal money, they get to deduct the amount received from the tax obligation. Looney estimates that there’s about $120 billion windfall for big business from the stimulus bill provision. Billions also go to US allies, including $3.3 billion in grants to Israel, $1.3 billion to Egypt, $461.3 million for Colombia, $453 to Ukraine, $700 million to Sudan, $241.4 million for Tunisia, $135 to Myanmar, $130 million to Nepal, $85.5 million to Cambodia, $25 million to Pakistan, and $1.4 billion for a so-called Asia Reassurance Initiative Act that aims to counter China. Another $500 million goes for so-called Israeli cooperative programs that include purchases of US weapons. Nothing goes for Occupied Palestinians. $40 million is for further destabilizing Syria. $710 million goes for countering ISIS and likeminded jihadist groups that’s all about supporting them. $3 billion is for continuing permanent occupation of Afghanistan. $400 million goes to Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman. A Caribbean Basin Security Initiative gets $74.8 million. $290 million goes for countering Russia, $132 million to neighboring Georgia. All of the above is related to advancing US imperial interests — at the expense of widespread unemployment, food insecurity, hunger, homelessness, and overall deprivation in the US. $208 billion for the Census Bureau is for upgrading it computer systems. The Kennedy Center gets $40 million. There’s $193 million for federal HIV/AIDS workers — not for their daily activities, to buy cars and insurance overseas. A feminist museum got funding. More goes for addressing “youth risk behaviors” and establishing a commission to educate consumers about dangers related to “storing portable fuel containers for flammable liquids near an open flame.” There’s $70 million for “internet freedom” that’s all about controlling the message by stifling dissent. All of the above is in heavily pork-laden HR 133, likely a whole lot more of the same crammed into its 5,500+ plus pages. It’s the most lengthy congressional bill in US history that passed both houses by large majorities. So-called “democracy programs (aka advancing US imperial interests at the expense of peace, equity and justice)” got over $2.4 billion. Nearly $6.2 billion more goes for foreign military financing programs. $300 million is for countering China’s “malign influence,” $33 million for “democracy programs” in Venezuela that aim to eliminate Bolivarian social justice. Of their combined 535 congressional members, only 53 House and 6 Senate members opposed the measure. Trump may veto HR 133 in its present form. He called on Congress to “increase the ridiculously low” relief for US households. He wants it raised to $2,000 per adult, $4,000 for couples, along with “get(ging) rid of wasteful and unnecessary items” in the measure. Dems, including Pelosi, said they’ll push for “unanimous (congressional) consent” pre-Christmas. Only 59 of 535 congressional members opposed the bill. A veto-proof majority supports it. It’s highly likely heading for enactment into law — warts and all. A Final Comment Ignored by the White House, Congress and establishment media is what’s most needed at a time of the greatest economic Depression in US history — large-scale jobs creation programs. Real unemployment exceeds 26%. Most working-age Americans with jobs are way-underemployed. During the 1930s Great Depression, FDR and Congress initiated an alphabet soup of jobs creation programs that put millions of unemployed Americans back to work. No jobs creation programs were initiated today by the White House or Congress. They’re vitally needed to put unemployed Americans back to work with full-time employment earning a living wage and receiving essential benefits that includes healthcare coverage. When people have a steady source of income to rely on, they spend it. It stimulates economic growth. Stopgap stimulus measures provide short-term relief and woefully not enough. Instead of re-industrializing and otherwise rebuilding America, the nation is in decline, notably at the expense of its ordinary people. Instead of a long-ago land of opportunity, today’s America is thirdworldized for most of its people. It’s an increasingly totalitarian, plutocratic, kleptocratic police state, democracy for its privileged few alone. Wealth, power and privileged interests never had things better. Ordinary people are one or two missed paychecks away from impoverishment, food insecurity, overall deprivation and despair during what’s likely to be protracted Depression conditions. When large-scale federal programs are vitally needed to change things, they’re nowhere in sight.
TWO GORILLAS AT SAN DIEGO ZOO TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AFTER BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY DRUNK WOMAN | Two gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park have tested positive for COVID-19 after being sexually assaulted by a drunk woman last week. Latifa Jones, 36, was arrested last Saturday for breaking and entering the facility of the San Diego Zoo Safari Park around 11 pm. Video footage later revealed that the heavily intoxicated woman entered the gorilla enclave and sexually assaulted two of the three male gorillas present. “It appears the woman was an ex-girlfriend of a San Diego Zoo employee and apparently attempted to make her former lover jealous by taking erotic selfies with the gorillas,” Officer Lucy Sheldon of the San Diego Police told the press.  we believe prefers the male gender,” caretaker Rodrigo Sanchez told reporters. The 22-minute video footage allegedly shows Jones denuding herself, taking pictures of erotic nature with the animals as well as engaging in complete sexual intercourse with the gorillas. “Gorillas do not practice oral sex in the wild or in a domesticated setting, so it was a first time for Big George and Popeye, and both seemed to get a real kick out of it,” one employee admitted with humor after visualizing the video footage. A psychological evaluation of the woman revealed that the confinement may have accentuated her mental illness symptoms and libido. No charges of bestiality have been put forward at the moment by the San Diego Zoo Safari Park as the animals do not appear to have suffered any psychological trauma or physical injuries and did seem to “enjoy the brief company” one administrator even commented.
12-YEAR-OLD SUCCESSFULLY SUES PARENTS OVER “FALSE PROMISES” AFTER NOT RECEIVING XBOX FOR CHRISTMAS | A 12-year-old from Idaho has successfully sued his parents after they promised him an Xbox for Christmas, a gift he never received. Parents Nicholas Halley, 41, and Johanna Spitzberg, 39, were shocked to learn last week that their 12-year-old had summoned them to the small claims court over an Xbox. Their surprise turned to frustration this week after Judge Andrew Reynolds ordered them to buy their 12-year-old son an Xbox and gave them a lecture on their moral duties as parents not to make false promises and not to lie to their children. “After analyzing the overwhelming evidence, I find the defendants guilty as charged and order them to secure an Xbox to the plaintiff by the end of this week,” Judge Andrew Reynolds ruled in court. “It was truly humiliating to hear the judge scold us before an audience and tell us how miserably we had failed as parents by making false promises and lying to our son,” mother Johanna Spitzberg, 39, told reporters in tears, visibly ashamed. The 12-year-old had accumulated an impressive amount of evidence according to Judge Reynolds that proved without a doubt that the parents were at fault. “I had taken pictures of my room every week after I cleaned it and showed the judge my school grades and gave him the contract my parents made me sign and the list of things I had to do in exchange of getting an Xbox for Christmas” Jeffrey Halley, 12, told reporters. Apparently, Judge Reynolds was convinced that the young boy had “successfully fulfilled all elements included in the agreement” and that the contract was “enforceable by law” as such. The parents of the 12-year-old are obligated by law to buy their son an Xbox by the end of the week and could face jail time of up to 15 days or more if they do not comply according to legal experts.
GRETA THUNBERG: “CORONAVIRUS IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE PLANET SINCE THE BUBONIC PLAGUE” | Greta Thunberg the young Swedish environmental activist surprised many this week with shocking claims on the coronavirus. The young activist who is internationally known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action against climate change posted a list of her top 25 favorite diseases to have decimated humanity. Cholera, bubonic plague, smallpox, and influenza came at the top of the morbid list totaling an impressive one billion deaths but she also gave a special shout out to Ebola, malaria, and AIDS for which she said there was “great potential” for a future comeback. “Coronavirus is a great virus, not as great as the bubonic plague or the Spanish flu, but still it is pretty good. I don’t know if it was made in a laboratory or not but if it is, great work guys,” she told reporters. The young 17-year-old activist received a standing ovation during a memorable speech at Davos earlier this year when she pleaded world leaders to develop a vaccine to curb the earth’s human population by forced sterilization which left Bill Gates weeping. “To know that our youth understands that human depopulation is our number one end goal just melts my heart,” a visibly emotional Bill Gates said in tears. Thunberg also shocked many Canadians last September during Suicide Awareness Month while promoting suicide as “a great way to curb global warming” and took time to celebrate the memories of those “heroes who decided to do the right thing for the planet” she wrote on her Twitter account. A number of experts have cast doubts on the real identity of Greta Thunberg, one Swedish private investigator even claiming that her true identity is that of Olga Feinchenenberg, a 54-year-old environmentalist suffering from dwarfism.
NEW JERSEY BROTHER AND SISTER ALLOWED TO MARRY AFTER 10-YEAR-LONG COURT BATTLE | A New Jersey brother and sister have won the right to marry after a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States. In a 5-to-4 ruling, five judges unanimously granted the appeal by James Banes, 41, and Victoria Banes, 38, today after a ten-year-long battle.  The overjoyed pair said they did it for the ‘millions of Americans who have consensual incestuous relationships and who are living in fear’ and blasted the Government for wasting taxpayers’ money fighting their challenge. “Incest has been practiced by humans since the dawn of time. If Adam and Eve hadn’t done it, the human race would not be here today,” James Banes told reporters after his historic victory. The Banes family lawyer, Julianne Grey, argued that criminalizing incestuous marriage while first-cousin marriage was legal in the state of New Jersey was a nonsensical and discriminatory measure. “Why am I allowed to bang my cousin but not my sister? It just doesn’t make any sense,” James Banes criticized outside of court. The couple that was currently facing up to 15 years in jail said that they were now planning to start a large family and enjoy their newly found freedom. “We’ve always dreamed of having a big family, now this dream will become a reality” added Victoria Banes, who also told reporters she is pregnant and expecting twins. Previously, New Jersey state laws only allowed first-cousin marriages but since the landmark ruling, New Jersey is now the only state in the country to also allow incestuous marriages.
WOMAN SUES SAMSUNG FOR $1.8M AFTER CELL PHONE GETS STUCK INSIDE HER VAGINA | An Albuquerque woman is suing Samsung for $1.8 million after she necessitated medical attention after inserting her cell phone inside her vagina and was unable to retrieve it for 96 hours. Salma Briant, 39, claims her medical bills at the University of New Mexico Hospital amount to $1,168,000 and that she has suffered from severe psychological distress because of the whole ordeal. Briant said she first inserted the cell phone inside her vagina as a dare from one of her friends but quickly realized that the phone would not come out. “I wanted to see how it would feel to put my cell phone on vibration mode inside of me, just for fun, but it soon turned out to be a nightmare,” she told judge Andrew Peterson in tears. Attorney Jim McAfee’s claims his client was forced to undergo a cesarean section to remove the cell phone because of the atypical shape of her pelvis and had no insurance at the time. “Samsung is definitely at fault here as they offer no warning about the dangers and potential risks during the insertion of their products inside their clients male or female body cavities or genitals” Salma Briant’s lawyer, Jim McAfee said in court. A Samsung spokesman said they would not comment on this case at this moment but explained that an out-of-court settlement was still an option on the table. Apple faced a similar lawsuit in 2014 after a man had attempted to swallow fourteen iPhones and ended up in the emergency room for mercury poisoning. Apple was eventually forced to legally specify that their products were not fit for human consumption and the man was conceded an undisclosed amount of money.
ICELAND OFFICIALLY BECOMES FIRST GLUTEN-FREE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD | Iceland has officially become the world’s first gluten-free country has announced Icelandic Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir today. The much-debated gluten bill was passed in Alþingi, the Icelandic parliament, last year and scheduled a nationwide ban by the end of 2020. Gluten intolerance is one of the leading causes of global warming according to a devastating 2019 climate change report. “Farts caused by obese gluten intolerant people are not only disgusting and malodorous, but scientists have shown that large emissions of Co2 and greenhouse gases are linked to gluten consumption in humans, “Jakobsdóttir explained during a press conference. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir said the idea of the bill first came after the current Icelandic President, Guðni Jóhannesson, was diagnosed as gluten intolerant last year and deputies complained about pungent and foul odors within the parliament. “The president’s farting had become unbearable, deputies and ministers would call in sick because of the odor, and so the deputies decided to act upon it to avert a political crisis,” Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir added. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year concluded that an average 600-pound American emitted twice as much greenhouse gas as cattle of the same weight. “Human farts are now believed to be the most important factor in anthropogenic global warming, bypassing fossil fuels according to recent studies,” IPCC researcher Indira Vashanagurati explained. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir hopes that other countries will follow the lead of what she has described as an “anti-fat, anti-odor, and anti-farting” green revolution.
JAPANESE WHALING CREW EATEN ALIVE BY KILLER WHALES, 16 DEAD | A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning. The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil. The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears. Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean. The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling. “It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds. Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.
RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS DISCOVER CURE TO HOMOSEXUALITY | Novosibirsk Dr. Dimitri Yusrokov Slamini of the Russian Institute for Medical Science in Novosibirsk and his team of researchers have discovered what they claim to be a new vaccine which could prevent early symptoms and even cure humans of homosexuality if treated at a young age. Russian scientists developed the so-called «antidote» based on a 1959 scientific research published under the title “Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig” by Charles H. Phoenix, an American researcher. The study concluded that “INAH [part of the hypothalamus] is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate”. Iran, China and Saudi Arabia have been the first countries to show interest in the new discovery. «Xenoestrogen are a type of estrogen mimickers found in synthetic or natural chemical compounds. Synthetic xenoestrogens such as PCB’s, BPA and phthalates have been also been found to have estrogenic effects on living organisms and to disrupt the endocrine system» explains Dr. Yuri Krutchev, who took part in the experiment. «Injecting specific quantities of testosterone helps to «Injecting specific quantities of testosterone helps to upset this artificial biological unbalance which occurs mostly in part because of environmental pollution and an excess of estrogen mimickers in our modern environment» he adds. The new discovery has attracted much criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations around the Globe, yet a few country leaders have outspokenly shown support and interest for the research. Iran, China, and Saudi Arabia have been the first countries to show interest in the new discovery. American and European researchers have expressed much skepticism upon receiving the news.
PREHISTORIC CAVE ART DEPICTING HUMANS HUNTING DINOSAURS DISCOVERED IN KUWAIT | Kuwait A 67-year old sheperd looking for one of his animals, stumbled upon what could be one of the most astonishing discoveries of modern archeology. The man noticed a barely visible entrance to a group of caves covered with prehistoric art depicting many humans and animals, but also a few live dinosaurs, bringing many questions concerning the chronology of the extinction of these gigantic creatures. “At first, we thought these were modern grafitis” explains Abdul Al-Shalafi, the paleontologist recently named in charge of the site, “but the carbon dating analysis revealed that they were in fact, older than the rest of the drawings. It seems that these were probably the first images drawn in the cave, and they seem to relate to the earliest period of development of this settlement.” These amazing work of arts combined with dinosaur bones discovered on the spot, bring aa all new perspective to the theories concerning the disappearance of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago. It now seems plausible that humans could actually have coexisted with these incredible creatures until a few hundred thousand years ago. “These prehistoric pictograms seem to illustrate dinosaurs being hunted by humans” adds Mr Al-Shalafi. “This could mean that humans are actually to blame for their extermination. This is certainly a revolutionnary new perspective and it will certainly be hard for many historians and archeologists to accept.”
IRISH PFIZER PLANT RELEASES 750 TONS OF VIAGRA IN RIVER, THOUSANDS OF SHEEP GO ON A SEX CRAZE | Irish shepherds finally got an answer concerning their animals’ uncontrollable sex urges, as the pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer admitted that one of its drug-manufacturing plants accidentally spilled more than 755 tons of unfiltered Viagra in the waters of Ringaskiddy Harbour over the last week. Hundreds of shepherds across southern Ireland had complained over the last week that their animals behaved very strangely and were sexually overactive. During an interview with RTÉ One this morning, Michael Murphy, a shepherd from the nearby village of Raffeen, described his animals as “behaving like sex maniacs”. “They kept humping everything they saw! Not only each other but also my dogs, my children, the fences… it was scary as hell!” Several rumors rapidly spread to explain the sudden symptoms which affected over 80,000 sheep and a few hundred heads of cattle. Mr. Murphy says he always suspected Pfizer but feared it could be a new disease similar to the mad cow disease but affecting mostly sheep. “We were afraid that some government experts would say they were suffering from some horny sheep disease or something, and that we’d have to kill them all.” Michael Murphy says his animals are just starting to calm down after a weeklong sex craze, 48 hours after Pfizer finally fixed the problem. Pfizer denied any responsibility last week when the problem was first reported, claiming its facility had a “fail-proof security system” and met “the highest environmental standards”. After the numbers of reports increased and the problem started getting worse, the company ordered an inspection of its installation and discovered a problem with its waste filtration system, leading to the contamination of an underground river. The system was repaired on Sunday and the problem now seems to be resorbing, but it could take weeks before all infected animals’ behavior comes back to normal. This isn’t the first time Pfizer has a problem with this specific factory. In 2017 villagers from Ringaskiddy filed a class-action lawsuit after fumes from the plant were found to have arousing effects on both humans and animals. Despite the installation of new particle filters and a new air filtration system, the locals still have a saying about the air: “One whiff and you’re stiff.”
